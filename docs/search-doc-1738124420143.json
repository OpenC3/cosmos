ERB is a templating system for Ruby which allows you to use Ruby logic and variables to generate text files. There are two basic forms of ERB:  &lt;% Ruby code -- no output %&gt; &lt;%= Ruby expression -- insert result %&gt;   In a COSMOS Telemetry configuration file we could write the following:  &lt;% (1..5).each do |i| %&gt; APPEND_ITEM VALUE&lt;%= i %&gt; 16 UINT &quot;Value &lt;%= i %&gt; setting&quot; &lt;% end %&gt;   The first line is Ruby code which iterates from 1 up to and including 5 and places the value in the variable i. The code inside the block will be output to the file every time the iteration runs. The APPEND_ITEM line uses the value of i and directly outputs it to the file by using the &lt;%= syntax. The result of the parsing will look like the following:  APPEND_ITEM VALUE1 16 UINT &quot;Value 1 setting&quot; APPEND_ITEM VALUE2 16 UINT &quot;Value 2 setting&quot; APPEND_ITEM VALUE3 16 UINT &quot;Value 3 setting&quot; APPEND_ITEM VALUE4 16 UINT &quot;Value 4 setting&quot; APPEND_ITEM VALUE5 16 UINT &quot;Value 5 setting&quot;   COSMOS uses ERB syntax extensively in a Plugin's plugin.txt configuration file.

The render method takes a parameter which is the name of the configuration file to inject into the top level file. This file is required to start with underscore to avoid being processed as a regular configuration file. This file is called a partial since it's part of a larger file. For example, _ccsds_apid.txt is defined as follows:   APPEND_ID_ITEM CCSDSAPID 11 UINT &lt;%= apid %&gt; &quot;CCSDS application process id&quot;   This would result in output as follows:  TELEMETRY INST HEALTH_STATUS BIG_ENDIAN &quot;Health and status&quot; APPEND_ID_ITEM CCSDSAPID 11 UINT 1 &quot;CCSDS application process id&quot; APPEND_ITEM COLLECTS 16 UINT &quot;Number of collects&quot; ...

Either raw binary packets or decommutated JSON packets can be requested. This API is implemented over Websockets using the Rails ActionCable framework. Actioncable client libraries are known to exist for at least Javascript, Ruby, and Python. Other languages may exist or could be created. Websockets allow for easy interaction with the new COSMOS 5 Javascript based frontend. The following interactions are all shown in Javascript, but would be very similar in any language. Connecting to this API begins by initiating an ActionCable connection. cable = ActionCable.createConsumer('/openc3-api/cable') This call opens the HTTP connection to the given URL and upgrades it to a websocket connection. This connection can then be shared with multiple “subscriptions”. A subscription describes a set of data that you want the API to stream to you. Creating a subscription looks like this: subscription = cable.subscriptions.create( { channel: &quot;StreamingChannel&quot;, scope: &quot;DEFAULT&quot;, token: token, }, { received: (data) =&gt; { // Handle received data }, connected: () =&gt; { // First chance to add what you want to stream here }, disconnected: () =&gt; { // Handle the subscription being disconnected }, rejected: () =&gt; { // Handle the subscription being rejected }, } ); Subscribing to the StreamingApi requires passing a channel name set to “StreamingChannel”, a scope which is typically “DEFAULT”, and an access token (a password in OpenSource COSMOS). In Javascript you also pass a set of callback functions that run at various lifecycle points in the subscription. The most important of these are connected and received. connected runs when the subscription is accepted by the StreamApi. This callback is the first opportunity to request specific data that you would like streamed. Data can also be added or removed at any time while the subscription is open. Data can be added to the stream by requesting individual items from a packet or by requesting the entire packet. Adding items to stream is done as follows: var items = [ [&quot;DECOM__TLM__INST__ADCS__Q1__RAW&quot;, &quot;0&quot;], [&quot;DECOM__CMD__INST__COLLECT__DURATION__WITH_UNITS&quot;, &quot;1&quot;], ]; OpenC3Auth.updateToken(OpenC3Auth.defaultMinValidity).then(() =&gt; { this.subscription.perform(&quot;add&quot;, { scope: window.openc3Scope, token: localStorage.openc3Token, items: items, start_time: this.startDateTime, end_time: this.endDateTime, }); }); The values in the item name are separated by double underscores, e.g. &lt;MODE&gt;__&lt;CMD or TLM&gt;__&lt;TARGET NAME&gt;__&lt;PACKET NAME&gt;__&lt;ITEM NAME&gt;__&lt;VALUE TYPE&gt;__&lt;REDUCED TYPE&gt;. Mode is either RAW, DECOM, REDUCED_MINUTE, REDUCED_HOUR, or REDUCED_DAY. The next parameter is CMD or TLM followed by the target, packet and item names. The Value Type is one of RAW, CONVERTED, FORMATTED, or WITH_UNITS. The last parameter is optional if you want to use the reduced data types. Reduced Type is one of SAMPLE, MIN, MAX, AVG, or STDDEV. Adding packets to stream is done as follows: var packets = [ [&quot;RAW__TLM__INST__ADCS&quot;, &quot;0&quot;], [&quot;DECOM__TLM__INST__HEALTH_STATUS__FORMATTED&quot;, &quot;1&quot;], ]; OpenC3Auth.updateToken(OpenC3Auth.defaultMinValidity).then(() =&gt; { this.subscription.perform(&quot;add&quot;, { scope: window.openc3Scope, token: localStorage.openc3Token, packets: packets, start_time: this.startDateTime, end_time: this.endDateTime, }); }); The values in the packet name are separated by double underscores, e.g. &lt;MODE&gt;__&lt;CMD or TLM&gt;__&lt;TARGET NAME&gt;__&lt;PACKET NAME&gt;__&lt;VALUE TYPE&gt;. Mode is either RAW or DECOM. The next parameter is CMD or TLM followed by the target and packet names. The Value Type is one of RAW, CONVERTED, FORMATTED, or WITH_UNITS. For Raw mode, VALUE TYPE should be set to RAW or omitted (e.g. TLM__INST__ADCS__RAW or TLM__INST__ADCS). start_time and end_time are standard COSMOS 64-bit integer timestamps in nanoseconds since the Unix Epoch (midnight January 1st, 1970). If start_time is null, that indicates to start streaming from the current time in realtime, indefinitely until items are removed, or the subscription is unsubscribed. end_time is ignored if start_time is null. If start_time is given and end_time is null, that indicates to playback from the given starttime and then continue indefinitely in realtime. If both start_time and end_time are given, then that indicates a temporary playback of historical data. Data returned by the streaming API is handled by the received callback in Javascript. Data is returned as a JSON Array, with a JSON object in the array for each packet returned. Results are batched, and the current implementation will return up to 100 packets in each batch (the array will have 100 entries). 100 packets per batch is not guaranteed, and batches may take on varying sizes based on the size of the data returned, or other factors. An empty array indicates that all data has been sent for a purely historical query and can be used as an end of data indicator. For decommutated items, each packet is represented as a JSON object with a 'time' field holding the COSMOS nanosecond timestamp of the packet, and then each of the requested item keys with their corresponding value from the packet. [ { &quot;time&quot;: 1234657585858, &quot;TLM__INST__ADCS__Q1__RAW&quot;: 50.0, &quot;TLM__INST__ADCS__Q2__RAW&quot;: 100.0 }, { &quot;time&quot;: 1234657585859, &quot;TLM__INST__ADCS__Q1__RAW&quot;: 60.0, &quot;TLM__INST__ADCS__Q2__RAW&quot;: 110.0 } ] For raw packets, each packet is represented as a JSON object with a time field holding the COSMOS nanosecond timestamp of the packet, a packet field holding the topic the packet was read from in the form of SCOPE__TELEMETRY__TARGETNAME__PACKETNAME, and a buffer field holding a BASE64 encoded copy of the packet data.

One large file can be used to define the command packets, or multiple files can be used at the user's discretion. Command definition files are placed in the target's cmd_tlm directory and are processed alphabetically. Therefore if you have some command files that depend on others, e.g. they override or extend existing commands, they must be named last. The easiest way to do this is to add an extension to an existing file name. For example, if you already have cmd.txt you can create cmd_override.txt for commands that depends on the definitions in cmd.txt. Also note that due to the way the ASCII Table is structured, files beginning with capital letters are processed before lower case letters.  When defining command parameters you can choose from the following data types: INT, UINT, FLOAT, STRING, BLOCK. These correspond to integers, unsigned integers, floating point numbers, strings and binary blocks of data. The only difference between a STRING and BLOCK is when COSMOS reads the binary command log it stops reading a STRING type when it encounters a null byte (0).

The class must inherit from Conversion. It must implement the initialize (Ruby) or __init__ (Python) method if it takes extra parameters and must always implement the call method. The conversion factor is applied to the value entered by the user before it is written into the binary command packet and sent.  When applying a write_conversion sometimes the data type changes, e.g. creating a UINT from an input STRING (for an example of this seeip_write_conversion.rbor ip_write_conversion.py). In this case, the command definition data type is UINT and the min, max values don't matter (but must be given) so are typically set to MIN MAX. The default value is important and should be specified as a string. For a full example see the IP_ADDRESS parameter in the TIME_OFFSET command definition of the COSMOS DemoINST inst_cmds.txtor INST2 inst_cmds.txt.  Multiple write conversions on command parameters When a command is built, each item gets written (and write conversions are run) to set the default value. Then items are written (again write conversions are run) with user provided values. Thus write conversions can be run twice. Also there are no guarantees which parameters have already been written. The packet itself has a given_values() method which can be used to retrieve a hash of the user provided values to the command. That can be used to check parameter values passed in.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredClass Filename\tThe filename which contains the Ruby or Python class. The filename must be named after the class such that the class is a CamelCase version of the underscored filename. For example, 'the_great_conversion.rb' should contain 'class TheGreatConversion'.\tTrue Parameter\tAdditional parameter values for the conversion which are passed to the class constructor.\tFalse  Ruby Example:  WRITE_CONVERSION the_great_conversion.rb 1000 Defined in the_great_conversion.rb: require 'openc3/conversions/conversion' module OpenC3 class TheGreatConversion &lt; Conversion def initialize(multiplier) super() @multiplier = multiplier.to_f end def call(value, packet, buffer) return value * multiplier end end end   Python Example:  WRITE_CONVERSION the_great_conversion.py 1000 Defined in the_great_conversion.py: from openc3.conversions.conversion import Conversion class TheGreatConversion(Conversion): def __init__(self, multiplier): super().__init__() self.multiplier = float(multiplier) def call(self, value, packet, buffer): return value * self.multiplier   POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION​  Adds a polynomial conversion factor to the current command parameter  The conversion factor is applied to the value entered by the user before it is written into the binary command packet and sent.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredC0\tCoefficient\tTrue Cx\tAdditional coefficient values for the conversion. Any order polynomial conversion may be used so the value of 'x' will vary with the order of the polynomial. Note that larger order polynomials take longer to process than shorter order polynomials, but are sometimes more accurate.\tFalse  Example Usage:  POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION 10 0.5 0.25   SEG_POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION​  Adds a segmented polynomial conversion factor to the current command parameter  This conversion factor is applied to the value entered by the user before it is written into the binary command packet and sent.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredLower Bound\tDefines the lower bound of the range of values that this segmented polynomial applies to. Is ignored for the segment with the smallest lower bound.\tTrue C0\tCoefficient\tTrue Cx\tAdditional coefficient values for the conversion. Any order polynomial conversion may be used so the value of 'x' will vary with the order of the polynomial. Note that larger order polynomials take longer to process than shorter order polynomials, but are sometimes more accurate.\tFalse  Example Usage:  SEG_POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION 0 10 0.5 0.25 # Apply the conversion to all values &lt; 50 SEG_POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION 50 11 0.5 0.275 # Apply the conversion to all values &gt;= 50 and &lt; 100 SEG_POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION 100 12 0.5 0.3 # Apply the conversion to all values &gt;= 100   GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_START​  Start a generic write conversion  Adds a generic conversion function to the current command parameter. This conversion factor is applied to the value entered by the user before it is written into the binary command packet and sent. The conversion is specified as Ruby or Python code that receives two implied parameters. 'value' which is the raw value being written and 'packet' which is a reference to the command packet class (Note, referencing the packet as 'myself' is still supported for backwards compatibility). The last line of code should return the converted value. The GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_END keyword specifies that all lines of code for the conversion have been given.  Multiple write conversions on command parameters When a command is built, each item gets written (and write conversions are run) to set the default value. Then items are written (again write conversions are run) with user provided values. Thus write conversions can be run twice. Also there are no guarantees which parameters have already been written. The packet itself has a given_values() method which can be used to retrieve a hash of the user provided values to the command. That can be used to check parameter values passed in.  warning Generic conversions are not a good long term solution. Consider creating a conversion class and using WRITE_CONVERSION instead. WRITE_CONVERSION is easier to debug and higher performance.  Ruby Example:  APPEND_PARAMETER ITEM1 32 UINT 0 0xFFFFFFFF 0 GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_START return (value * 1.5).to_i # Convert the value by a scale factor GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_END   Python Example:  APPEND_PARAMETER ITEM1 32 UINT 0 0xFFFFFFFF 0 GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_START return int(value * 1.5) # Convert the value by a scale factor GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_END   GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_END​  Complete a generic write conversion  OVERFLOW​  Set the behavior when writing a value overflows the type  By default OpenC3 throws an error if you try to write a value which overflows its specified type, e.g. writing 255 to a 8 bit signed value. Setting the overflow behavior also allows for OpenC3 to 'TRUNCATE' the value by eliminating any high order bits. You can also set 'SATURATE' which causes OpenC3 to replace the value with the maximum or minimum allowable value for that type. Finally you can specify 'ERROR_ALLOW_HEX' which will allow for a maximum hex value to be written, e.g. you can successfully write 255 to a 8 bit signed value.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredBehavior\tHow OpenC3 treats an overflow value. Only applies to signed and unsigned integer data types.

This is especially true in the commonly used CCSDS Space Packet Protocol. The best way to illustrate this is with an example. Suppose you have CCSDS Space Packets prepended with a Sync Pattern of 0x1ACFFC1D. This would look like the following:  Sync (4 bytes)\tHeader (4 bytes)\tLength (2 bytes)\tData (4 bytes)0x1ACFFC1D\t0x0001CADB\t0x0003\t0xDEADBEEF  In this case the total length of the packet is 14 bytes: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 14. With 4 bytes of data, the length field is 3 because in CCSDS the length field is calculated as (data length - 1). So how would we calculate the Length Value Offset? COSMOS reads all the bytes in the packet (including the Sync Pattern) so the total length is 14 bytes. The length field is 3 so the Length Value Offset (offset to apply to the length field value) should be 11 (3 + 11 = 14).

For outgoing packets, a CMD_TEMPLATE field is expected to exist in the packet. This field contains a template string with items to be filled in delineated within HTML tag style brackets &quot;&lt;EXAMPLE&gt;&quot;.

However, creating custom Interfaces is still useful for defaulting parameters to values that always are fixed for your target and for including the necessary Protocols. The base COSMOS Interfaces take a lot of parameters that can be confusing to your end users. Thus you may want to create a custom Interface just to hard coded these values and cut the available parameters down to something like the hostname and port to connect to.  All custom Protocols should derive from the Protocol class openc3/interfaces/protocols/protocol.rb (Ruby) and openc3/interfaces/protocols/protocol.py (Python). This class defines the 9 methods that are relevant to writing your own protocol. The base class implementation for each method is included below as well as a discussion as to how the methods should be overridden and used in your own Protocols.  Ruby Protocol APIs Protocols should not require 'openc3/script' since they are part of a COSMOS interface. They should use the COSMOS library code directly like System, Packet, Bucket, BinaryAccessor, etc. When in doubt, consult the existing COSMOS protocol classes.  Python Protocol APIs Protocols should not from openc3.script import * since they are part of a COSMOS interface. They should use the COSMOS library code directly like System, Packet, Bucket, BinaryAccessor, etc. When in doubt, consult the existing COSMOS protocol classes.  To really understand how Protocols work, you first must understand the logic within the base Interface class read and write methods.  Let's first discuss the read method.  Ruby Symbols, Python Strings In the following discussions an all caps word is a symbol in Ruby and a string in Python. So a reference to STOP means :STOP in Ruby and &quot;STOP&quot; in Python.    On every call to read, an empty string &quot;&quot; is first passed down to each of the read Protocol's read_data() method before new raw data is attempted to be read using the Interface's read_interface() method. This is a signal to Protocols that have cached up more than one packet worth of data to output those cached packets before any new data is read from the Interface. Typically no data will be cached up and one of the Protocols read_data() methods will return STOP in response to the empty string, indicating that more data is required to generate a packet. Each Protocol's read_data() method can return one of three things: data that will be passed down to any additional Protocols or turned into a Packet, STOP which means more data is required from the Interface for the Protocol to continue, or DISCONNECT which means that something has happened that requires disconnecting the Interface (and by default trying to reconnect). Each Protocol's read_data() method is passed the data that will eventually be turned into a packet and returns a possibly modified set of data. If the data passes through all Protocol's read_data() methods it is then converted into a COSMOS packet using the Interface's convert_data_to_packet() method. This packet is then run in a similar fashion through each Read Protocol's read_packet() method. This method has essentially the same return possibilities: a Packet (instead of data as in read_data()), STOP, or DISCONNECT. If the Packet makes it through all read_packet() methods then the Interface packet read counter is incremented and the Packet is returned to the Interface.    The Interface write() method works very similarly to read. (It should be mentioned that by default write protocols run in the reverse order of read protocols. This makes sense because when reading you're typically stripping layers of data and when writing you're typically adding on layers in reverse order.)  First, the packet write counter is incremented. Then each write Protocol is given a chance to modify the packet by its write_packet() method being called. This method can either return a potentially modified packet, STOP, or DISCONNECT. If a write Protocol returns STOP no data will be written out the Interface and it is assumed that more packets are necessary before a final packet can be output. DISCONNECT will disconnect the Interface. If the packet makes it through all the write Protocol's write_packet() methods, then it is converted to binary data using the Interface's convert_packet_to_data() method. Next the write_data() method is called for each write Protocol giving it a chance to modify the lower level data. The same return options are available except a Ruby string of data is returned instead of a COSMOS packet. If the data makes it through all write_data() methods, then it is written out on the Interface using the write_interface() method. Afterwards, each Protocol's post_write_interface() method is called with both the final modified Packet, and the actual data written out to the Interface. This method allows follow-up such as waiting for a response after writing out a message.

If you have Docker available, that is a simpler method.  Podman is an alternative container technology to Docker that is actively promoted by RedHat. The key benefit is that Podman can run without a root-level daemon service, making it significantly more secure by design, over standard Docker. However, it is a little more complicated to use. These directions will get you up and running with Podman. The following directions have been tested against RHEL 8.8, and RHEL 9.2, but should be similar on other operating systems.  Rootless Podman Does Not Work (Directly) with NFS Home Directories NFS does not work for holding container storage due to issues with user ids and group ids. There are workarounds available but they all involve moving container storage to another location: either a different partition on the host local disk, or into a special mounted disk image. See: [https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman-nfs]https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman-nfs). Note that there is also a newish Podman setting that allows you to more easily change where the storage location is in /etc/containers/storage.conf called rootless_storage_path. See https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/nfs-rootless-podman  Redhat 8.8 and 9.2 Instructions  Install Prerequisite Packages Note: This downloads and installs docker-compose from the latest 2.x release on Github.

Key aspects of this architecture:  COSMOS 5 is a cloud native, containerized, microservice oriented command and control system. All the COSMOS microservices are docker containers which is why Docker is shown containing the entire COSMOS system. The green boxes on the left represent external embedded systems (Targets) which COSMOS connects to. The Redis data store contains the configuration for all the microservices, the current value table, as well as data streams containing decommutated data. The Minio data store contains plugins, targets, configuration data, text logs as well as binary logs of all the raw, decommutated, and reduced data. Users interact with COSMOS from a web browser which routes through the internal Traefik load balancer.  COSMOS can connect to many different kinds of targets. The examples include things like Flight software (FSW), Ground Support Equipment (GSE), Labview, and COTS targets such as an Agilent power supply. Any embedded system that provides a communication interface can be connected to COSMOS.COSMOS ships with interfaces for connecting over TCP/IP, UDP, MQTT, and serial connections. This covers most systems, but custom interfaces can also be written to connect to anything.All realtime communication with targets flows through the COSMOS system.

Let's do it!  Install and Platform This guide assumes we're on Windows and COSMOS is installed in C:\\COSMOS. On Mac or Linux, change openc3.bat to openc3.sh and adjust paths as necessary to match your installation directory.  Before creating your own configuration you should uninstall the COSMOS Demo so you're working with a clean COSMOS system. Click the Admin button and the PLUGINS tab. Then click the Trash can icon next to openc3-cosmos-demo to delete it. When you go back to the Command and Telemetry Server you should have a blank table with no interfaces. If you followed the Installation Guide you should already be inside a cloned openc3-project which is in your PATH (necessary for openc3.bat / openc3.sh to be resolved). Inside this project it's recommended to edit the README.md (Markdown) to describe your program / project. Now we need to create a plugin. Plugins are how we add targets and microservices to COSMOS. Our plugin will contain a single target which contains all the information defining the packets (command and telemetry) that are needed to communicate with the target. Use the COSMOS plugin generator to create the correct structure.  Python vs Ruby Each CLI command requires the use of --python or --ruby unless you se the OPENC3_LANGUAGE environment variable to 'python' or 'ruby'.  C:\\openc3-project&gt; openc3.bat cli generate plugin BOB --python Plugin openc3-cosmos-bob successfully generated!   This should create a new directory called &quot;openc3-cosmos-bob&quot; with a bunch of files in it. The full description of all the files is explained by the Plugin Generator page.  Run as the Root user The cli runs as the default COSMOS container user which is the recommended practice. If you're having issues running as that user you can run as the root user (effectively docker run --user=root ) by running cliroot instead of cli in any of the examples.  Starting with COSMOS v5.5.0, the plugin generator creates just the plugin framework (previously it would also create a target). From within the newly created plugin directory, we generate a target. C:\\openc3-project&gt; cd openc3-cosmos-bob openc3-cosmos-bob&gt; openc3.bat cli generate target BOB --python Target BOB successfully generated!   Generators There are a number of generators available. Run openc3.bat cli generate to see all the available options.  The target generator creates a single target named BOB. Best practice is to create a single target per plugin to make it easier to share targets and upgrade them individually. Lets see what the target generator created for us. Open the openc3-cosmos-bob/targets/BOB/cmd_tlm/cmd.txt: COMMAND BOB EXAMPLE BIG_ENDIAN &quot;Packet description&quot; # Keyword Name BitSize Type Min Max Default Description APPEND_ID_PARAMETER ID 16 INT 1 1 1 &quot;Identifier&quot; APPEND_PARAMETER VALUE 32 FLOAT 0 10.5 2.5 &quot;Value&quot; APPEND_PARAMETER BOOL 8 UINT MIN MAX 0 &quot;Boolean&quot; STATE FALSE 0 STATE TRUE 1 APPEND_PARAMETER LABEL 0 STRING &quot;OpenC3&quot; &quot;The label to apply&quot; What does this all mean? We created a COMMAND for target BOB named EXAMPLE.The command is made up of BIG_ENDIAN parameters and is described by &quot;Packet description&quot;. Here we are using the append flavor of defining parameters which stacks them back to back as it builds up the packet and you don't have to worry about defining the bit offset into the packet.First we APPEND_ID_PARAMETER a parameter that is used to identify the packet called ID that is an 16-bit signed integer (INT) with a minimum value of 1, a maximum value of 1, and a default value of 1, that is described as the &quot;Identifier&quot;.Next we APPEND_PARAMETER a parameter called VALUE that is a 32-bit float (FLOAT) that has a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 10.5, and a default value of 2.5.Then we APPEND_PARAMETER a third parameter called BOOL which is a 8-bit unsigned integer (UINT) with a minimum value of MIN (meaning the smallest value a UINT supports, e.g 0), a maximum value of MAX (largest value a UINT supports, e.g. 255), and a default value of 0. BOOL has two states which are just a fancy way of giving meaning to the integer values 0 and 1. The STATE FALSE has a value of 0 and the STATE TRUE has a value of 1.Finally we APPEND_PARAMETER called LABEL which is a 0-bit (meaning it takes up all the remaining space in the packet) string (STRING) with a default value of &quot;OpenC3&quot;. Strings don't have minimum or maximum values as that doesn't make sense for STRING types. Check out the full Command documentation for more. Now open the openc3-cosmos-bob/targets/BOB/cmd_tlm/tlm.txt: TELEMETRY BOB STATUS BIG_ENDIAN &quot;Telemetry description&quot; # Keyword Name BitSize Type ID Description APPEND_ID_ITEM ID 16 INT 1 &quot;Identifier&quot; APPEND_ITEM VALUE 32 FLOAT &quot;Value&quot; APPEND_ITEM BOOL 8 UINT &quot;Boolean&quot; STATE FALSE 0 STATE TRUE 1 APPEND_ITEM LABEL 0 STRING &quot;The label to apply&quot; This time we created a TELEMETRY packet for target BOB called STATUS that contains BIG_ENDIAN items and is described as &quot;Telemetry description&quot;.We start by defininig an ID_ITEM called ID that is a 16-bit signed integer (INT) with an id value of 1 and described as &quot;Identifier&quot;. Id items are used to take unidentified blobs of bytes and determine which packet they are. In this case if a blob comes in with a value of 1, at bit offset 0 (since we APPEND this item first), interpreted as a 16-bit integer, then this packet will be &quot;identified&quot; as STATUS. Note the first packet defined without any ID_ITEMS is a &quot;catch-all&quot; packet that matches all incoming data (even if the data lengths don't match).Next we define three items similar to the command definition above. Check out the full Telemetry documentation for more. COSMOS has defined an example command and telemetry packet for our target. Most targets will obviously have more than one command and telemetry packet. To add more simply create additional COMMAND and TELEMETRY lines in your text files. Actual packets should match the structure of your command and telemetry. Be sure to add at least one unique ID_PARAMETER and ID_ITEM so your packets can be distinguished from each other. Now we need to tell COSMOS how to connect to our BOB target. Open the openc3-cosmos-bob/plugin.txt file: # Set VARIABLEs here to allow variation in your plugin # See [Plugins](../configuration/plugins) for more information VARIABLE bob_target_name BOB # Modify this according to your actual target connection # See [Interfaces](../configuration/interfaces) for more information TARGET BOB &lt;%= bob_target_name %&gt; INTERFACE &lt;%= bob_target_name %&gt;_INT openc3/interfaces/tcpip_client_interface.py host.docker.internal 8080 8081 10.0 None BURST MAP_TARGET &lt;%= bob_target_name %&gt; This configures the plugin with a VARIABLE called bob_target_name with a default of &quot;BOB&quot;. When you install this plugin you will have the option to change the name of this target to something other than &quot;BOB&quot;. This is useful to avoid name conflicts and allows you to have multiple copies of the BOB target in your COSMOS system.The TARGET line declares the new BOB target using the name from the variable. The &lt;%= %&gt; syntax is called ERB (embedded Ruby) and allows us to put variables into our text files, in this case referencing our bob_target_name.The last line declares a new INTERFACE called (by default) BOB_INT that will connect as a TCP/IP client using the code in tcpip_client_interface.py to address host.docker.internal (This adds an /etc/hosts entry to the correct IP address for the host's gateway) using port 8080 for writing and 8081 for reading. It also has a write timeout of 10 seconds and reads will never timeout (nil). The TCP/IP stream will be interpreted using the COSMOS BURST protocol which means it will read as much data as it can from the interface. For all the details on how to configure COSMOS interfaces please see the Interface Guide. The MAP_TARGET line tells COSMOS that it will receive telemetry from and send commands to the BOB target using the BOB_INT interface.  Variables Support Reusability In a plugin that you plan to reuse you should make things like hostnames and ports variables  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Building Your Plugin​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"/docs/getting-started/gettingstarted#building-your-plugin","content":" Now we need to build our plugin and upload it to COSMOS. openc3-cosmos-bob&gt; openc3.bat cli rake build VERSION=1.0.0 Successfully built RubyGem Name: openc3-cosmos-bob Version: 1.0.0 File: openc3-cosmos-bob-1.0.0.gem Note that the VERSION is required to specify the version to build. We recommend semantic versioning when building your plugin so people using your plugin (including you) know when there are breaking changes. Once our plugin is built we need to upload it to COSMOS. Go back to the Admin page and click the Plugins Tab. Click on &quot;Click to install plugin&quot; and select the openc3-cosmos-bob-1.0.0.gem file. Then click Upload. Go back to the CmdTlmServer and you should see the plugin being deployed at which point the BOB_INT interface should appear and try to connect. Go ahead and click 'Cancel' because unless you really have something listening on port 8080 this will never connect. At this point you can explore the other CmdTlmServer tabs and other tools to see your newly defined BOB target. Let's modify our BOB target and then update the copy in COSMOS. If you open Command Sender in COSMOS to BOB EXAMPLE you should see the VALUE parameter has value 2.5. Open the openc3-cosmos-bob/targets/BOB/cmd_tlm/cmd.txt and change the Default value for VALUE to 5 and the description to &quot;New Value&quot;.

This time click the clock icon next to openc3-cosmos-bob-1.0.0 to Upgrade the plugin. Browse to the newly built plugin gem and select it. This will re-prompt for the plugin variables (bob_target_name) so don't change the name and just click OK. You should see a message about the plugin being installed at which point the plugins list will change to openc3-cosmos-bob-1.0.1.gem. Go back to Command Sender and you should see the new Default value for VALUE is 5 and the description is &quot;New Value&quot;. We have upgraded our plugin! At this point you can create a new plugin named after your real target and start modifying the interface and command and telemetry definitions to enable COSMOS to connect to and drive your target.

You will see all the requests and responses required to run a command and you can reformat them yourself to suit your own purposes. Below is an example of running a test script from a Chromium-based browser:  You can see that there are 5 transactions total. To investigate just right-click on the network transaction and click &quot;copy as curl&quot; (depends on the browser). Here is an example of the second one:  curl 'http://localhost:2900/script-api/scripts/TARGET/procedures/cmd_tlm_test.rb/lock?scope=DEFAULT' \\ -X 'POST' \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' \\ -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \\ -H 'Authorization: pass' \\ -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \\ -H 'Content-Length: 0' \\ -H 'Origin: http://ascportal:2900' \\ -H 'Referer: http://localhost:2900/tools/scriptrunner/?file=TARGET%2Fprocedures%2Fcmd_tlm_test.rb' \\ -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/124.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/124.0.0.0' \\ --insecure   Many of the browser-specific headers are not required.

However, note that APPEND does not work with little endian bitfields. Here are the rules on how COSMOS handles LITTLE_ENDIAN data: COSMOS bit offsets are always defined in BIG_ENDIAN terms. Bit 0 is always the most significant bit of the first byte in a packet, and increasing from there. All 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit byte-aligned LITTLE_ENDIAN data types define their bit_offset as the most significant bit of the first byte in the packet that contains part of the item. (This is exactly the same as BIG_ENDIAN). Note that for all except 8-bit LITTLE_ENDIAN items, this is the LEAST significant byte of the item. LITTLE_ENDIAN bit fields are defined as any LITTLE_ENDIAN INT or UINT item that is not 8, 16, 32, or 64-bit and byte aligned. LITTLE_ENDIAN bit fields must define their bit_offset as the location of the most significant bit of the bitfield in BIG_ENDIAN space as described in rule 1 above. So for example. The following C struct at the beginning of a packet would be defined like so: struct { unsigned short a:4; unsigned short b:8; unsigned short c:4; } ITEM A 4 4 UINT &quot;struct item a&quot; ITEM B 12 8 UINT &quot;struct item b&quot; ITEM C 8 4 UINT &quot;struct item c&quot; This is hard to visualize, but the structure above gets spread out in a byte array like the following after byte swapping: least significant 4 bits of b, 4-bits a, 4-bits c, most significant 4 bits of b. The best advice is to experiment and use the View Raw feature in the Command and Telemetry Service to inspect the bytes of the packet and adjust as necessary.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Telemetry","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/configuration/telemetry","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Telemetry Definition Files​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Telemetry","url":"/docs/configuration/telemetry#telemetry-definition-files","content":" Telemetry definition files define the telemetry packets that can be received and processed from COSMOS targets. One large file can be used to define the telemetry packets, or multiple files can be used at the user's discretion. Telemetry definition files are placed in the target's cmd_tlm directory and are processed alphabetically. Therefore if you have some telemetry files that depend on others, e.g. they override or extend existing telemetry, they must be named last. The easiest way to do this is to add an extension to an existing file name. For example, if you already have tlm.txt you can create tlm_override.txt for telemetry that depends on the definitions in tlm.txt. Note that due to the way the ASCII Table is structured, files beginning with capital letters are processed before lower case letters.  When defining telemetry items you can choose from the following data types: INT, UINT, FLOAT, STRING, BLOCK. These correspond to integers, unsigned integers, floating point numbers, strings and binary blocks of data. Within COSMOS, the only difference between a STRING and BLOCK is when COSMOS reads a STRING type it stops reading when it encounters a null byte (0). This shows up when displaying the value in Packet Viewer or Tlm Viewer and in the output of Data Extractor. You should strive to store non-ASCII data inside BLOCK items and ASCII strings in STRING items.  Printing Data Most data types can be printed in a COSMOS script simply by doing print(tlm(&quot;TGT PKT ITEM&quot;)). However, if the ITEM is a BLOCK data type and contains binary (non-ASCII) data then that won't work. COSMOS comes with a built-in method called formatted to help you view binary data. If ITEM is a BLOCK type containing binary try puts tlm(&quot;TGT PKT ITEM&quot;).formatted (Ruby) and print(formatted(tlm(&quot;TGT PKT ITEM&quot;))) (Python) which will print the bytes out as hex.

These items are defined using the ID_ITEM and APPEND_ID_ITEM. As data is read from the interface and refined by the protocol, the resulting packet is identified by matching all the ID fields. Note that ideally all packets in a particular target should use the exact same bit offset, bit size, and data type to identify. If this is not the case, you must set TLM_UNIQUE_ID_MODE in the target.txt file which incurs a performance penalty on every packet identification.

ITEM TEMP_AVERAGE 0 0 DERIVED &quot;Average of TEMP1, TEMP2, TEMP3, TEMP4&quot;   Note the bit offset and bit size of 0 and the data type of DERIVED. For this reason DERIVED items should be declared using ITEM rather than APPEND_ITEM. They can be defined anywhere in the packet definition but are typically placed at the end. The ITEM definition must be followed by a CONVERSION keyword, e.g. READ_CONVERSION, to generate the value.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Received Time and Packet Time​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Telemetry","url":"/docs/configuration/telemetry#received-time-and-packet-time","content":" COSMOS automatically creates several telemetry items on every packet: PACKET_TIMESECONDS, PACKET_TIMEFORMATTED, RECEIVED_COUNT, RECEIVED_TIMEFORMATTED, and RECEIVED_TIMESECONDS.  RECEIVED_TIME is the time that COSMOS receives the packet. This is set by the interface which is connected to the target and is receiving the raw data. Once a packet has been created out of the raw data the time is set.  PACKET_TIME defaults to RECEIVED_TIME, but can be set as a derived item with a time object in the telemetry configuration file. This helps support stored telemetry packets so that they can be more reasonably handled by other COSMOS tools such as Telemetry Grapher and Data Extractor. You can set the 'stored' flag in your interface and the current value table is unaffected.  The _TIMEFORMATTED items returns the date and time in a YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS.sss format and the _TIMESECONDS returns the Unix seconds of the time. Internally these are both stored as either a Ruby Time object or Python date object.  Example​  COSMOS provides a Unix time conversion class which returns a Ruby Time object or Python date object based on the number of seconds and (optionally) microseconds since the Unix epoch. Note: This returns a native object and not a float or string!

Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredKey\tThe string state name\tTrue Value\tThe numerical state value or ANY to apply the state to all other values\tTrue Color\tThe color the state should be displayed as Valid Values: GREEN, YELLOW, RED\tFalse  Example Usage:  APPEND_ITEM ENABLE 32 UINT &quot;Enable setting&quot; STATE FALSE 0 STATE TRUE 1 STATE ERROR ANY # Match all other values to ERROR APPEND_ITEM STRING 1024 STRING &quot;String&quot; STATE &quot;NOOP&quot; &quot;NOOP&quot; GREEN STATE &quot;ARM LASER&quot; &quot;ARM LASER&quot; YELLOW STATE &quot;FIRE LASER&quot; &quot;FIRE LASER&quot; RED   READ_CONVERSION​  Applies a conversion to the current telemetry item  Conversions are implemented in a custom Ruby or Python file which should be located in the target's lib folder. The class must inherit from Conversion. It must implement the initialize (Ruby) or __init__ (Python) method if it takes extra parameters and must always implement the call method. The conversion factor is applied to the raw value in the telemetry packet before it is displayed to the user. The user still has the ability to see the raw unconverted value in a details dialog.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredClass Filename\tThe filename which contains the Ruby or Python class. The filename must be named after the class such that the class is a CamelCase version of the underscored filename. For example, 'the_great_conversion.rb' should contain 'class TheGreatConversion'.\tTrue Parameter\tAdditional parameter values for the conversion which are passed to the class constructor.\tFalse  Ruby Example:  READ_CONVERSION the_great_conversion.rb 1000 Defined in the_great_conversion.rb: require 'openc3/conversions/conversion' module OpenC3 class TheGreatConversion &lt; Conversion def initialize(multiplier) super() @multiplier = multiplier.to_f end def call(value, packet, buffer) return value * @multiplier end end end   Python Example:  READ_CONVERSION the_great_conversion.py 1000 Defined in the_great_conversion.py: from openc3.conversions.conversion import Conversion class TheGreatConversion(Conversion): def __init__(self, multiplier): super().__init__() self.multiplier = float(multiplier) def call(self, value, packet, buffer): return value * self.multiplier   POLY_READ_CONVERSION​  Adds a polynomial conversion factor to the current telemetry item  The conversion factor is applied to raw value in the telemetry packet before it is displayed to the user. The user still has the ability to see the raw unconverted value in a details dialog.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredC0\tCoefficient\tTrue Cx\tAdditional coefficient values for the conversion. Any order polynomial conversion may be used so the value of 'x' will vary with the order of the polynomial. Note that larger order polynomials take longer to process than shorter order polynomials, but are sometimes more accurate.\tFalse  Example Usage:  POLY_READ_CONVERSION 10 0.5 0.25   SEG_POLY_READ_CONVERSION​  Adds a segmented polynomial conversion factor to the current telemetry item  This conversion factor is applied to the raw value in the telemetry packet before it is displayed to the user. The user still has the ability to see the raw unconverted value in a details dialog.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredLower Bound\tDefines the lower bound of the range of values that this segmented polynomial applies to. Is ignored for the segment with the smallest lower bound.\tTrue C0\tCoefficient\tTrue Cx\tAdditional coefficient values for the conversion. Any order polynomial conversion may be used so the value of 'x' will vary with the order of the polynomial. Note that larger order polynomials take longer to process than shorter order polynomials, but are sometimes more accurate.\tFalse  Example Usage:  SEG_POLY_READ_CONVERSION 0 10 0.5 0.25 # Apply the conversion to all values &lt; 50 SEG_POLY_READ_CONVERSION 50 11 0.5 0.275 # Apply the conversion to all values &gt;= 50 and &lt; 100 SEG_POLY_READ_CONVERSION 100 12 0.5 0.3 # Apply the conversion to all values &gt;= 100   GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_START​  Start a generic read conversion  Adds a generic conversion function to the current telemetry item. This conversion factor is applied to the raw value in the telemetry packet before it is displayed to the user. The user still has the ability to see the raw unconverted value in a details dialog. The conversion is specified as Ruby or Python code that receives two implied parameters. 'value' which is the raw value being read and 'packet' which is a reference to the telemetry packet class (Note, referencing the packet as 'myself' is still supported for backwards compatibility). The last line of code should return the converted value. The GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END keyword specifies that all lines of code for the conversion have been given.  warning Generic conversions are not a good long term solution. Consider creating a conversion class and using READ_CONVERSION instead. READ_CONVERSION is easier to debug and has higher performance.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredConverted Type\tType of the converted value Valid Values: INT, UINT, FLOAT, STRING, BLOCK\tFalse Converted Bit Size\tBit size of converted value\tFalse  Ruby Example:  APPEND_ITEM ITEM1 32 UINT GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_START return (value * 1.5).to_i # Convert the value by a scale factor GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END   Python Example:  APPEND_ITEM ITEM1 32 UINT GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_START return int(value * 1.5) # Convert the value by a scale factor GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END   GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END​  Complete a generic read conversion  LIMITS​  Defines a set of limits for a telemetry item  If limits are violated a message is printed in the Command and Telemetry Server to indicate an item went out of limits. Other tools also use this information to update displays with different colored telemetry items or other useful information. The concept of &quot;limits sets&quot; is defined to allow for different limits values in different environments. For example, you might want tighter or looser limits on telemetry if your environment changes such as during thermal vacuum testing.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredLimits Set\tName of the limits set. If you have no unique limits sets use the keyword DEFAULT.\tTrue Persistence\tNumber of consecutive times the telemetry item must be within a different limits range before changing limits state.\tTrue Initial State\tWhether limits monitoring for this telemetry item is initially enabled or disabled. Note if you have multiple LIMITS items they should all have the same initial state. Valid Values: ENABLED, DISABLED\tTrue Red Low Limit\tIf the telemetry value is less than or equal to this value a Red Low condition will be detected\tTrue Yellow Low Limit\tIf the telemetry value is less than or equal to this value, but greater than the Red Low Limit, a Yellow Low condition will be detected\tTrue Yellow High Limit\tIf the telemetry value is greater than or equal to this value, but less than the Red High Limit, a Yellow High condition will be detected\tTrue Red High Limit\tIf the telemetry value is greater than or equal to this value a Red High condition will be detected\tTrue Green Low Limit\tSetting the Green Low and Green High limits defines an &quot;operational limit&quot; which is colored blue by OpenC3. This allows for a distinct desired operational range which is narrower than the green safety limit. If the telemetry value is greater than or equal to this value, but less than the Green High Limit, a Blue operational condition will be detected.\tFalse Green High Limit\tSetting the Green Low and Green High limits defines an &quot;operational limit&quot; which is colored blue by OpenC3. This allows for a distinct desired operational range which is narrower than the green safety limit. If the telemetry value is less than or equal to this value, but greater than the Green Low Limit, a Blue operational condition will be detected.\tFalse  Example Usage:  LIMITS DEFAULT 3 ENABLED -80.0 -70.0 60.0 80.0 -20.0 20.0 LIMITS TVAC 3 ENABLED -80.0 -30.0 30.0 80.0   LIMITS_RESPONSE​  Defines a response class that is called when the limits state of the current item changes  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredResponse Class Filename\tName of the Ruby or Python file which implements the limits response.

Laser will be fired!&quot;   WRITE_CONVERSION​  Applies a conversion when writing the current command parameter  Conversions are implemented in a custom Ruby or Python file which should be located in the target's lib folder. The class must inherit from Conversion. It must implement the initialize (Ruby) or __init__ (Python) method if it takes extra parameters and must always implement the call method. The conversion factor is applied to the value entered by the user before it is written into the binary command packet and sent.  When applying a write_conversion sometimes the data type changes, e.g. creating a UINT from an input STRING (for an example of this seeip_write_conversion.rbor ip_write_conversion.py). In this case, the command definition data type is UINT and the min, max values don't matter (but must be given) so are typically set to MIN MAX. The default value is important and should be specified as a string. For a full example see the IP_ADDRESS parameter in the TIME_OFFSET command definition of the COSMOS DemoINST inst_cmds.txtor INST2 inst_cmds.txt.  Multiple write conversions on command parameters When a command is built, each item gets written (and write conversions are run) to set the default value. Then items are written (again write conversions are run) with user provided values. Thus write conversions can be run twice. Also there are no guarantees which parameters have already been written. The packet itself has a given_values() method which can be used to retrieve a hash of the user provided values to the command. That can be used to check parameter values passed in.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredClass Filename\tThe filename which contains the Ruby or Python class. The filename must be named after the class such that the class is a CamelCase version of the underscored filename. For example, 'the_great_conversion.rb' should contain 'class TheGreatConversion'.\tTrue Parameter\tAdditional parameter values for the conversion which are passed to the class constructor.\tFalse  Ruby Example:  WRITE_CONVERSION the_great_conversion.rb 1000 Defined in the_great_conversion.rb: require 'openc3/conversions/conversion' module OpenC3 class TheGreatConversion &lt; Conversion def initialize(multiplier) super() @multiplier = multiplier.to_f end def call(value, packet, buffer) return value * multiplier end end end   Python Example:  WRITE_CONVERSION the_great_conversion.py 1000 Defined in the_great_conversion.py: from openc3.conversions.conversion import Conversion class TheGreatConversion(Conversion): def __init__(self, multiplier): super().__init__() self.multiplier = float(multiplier) def call(self, value, packet, buffer): return value * self.multiplier   POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION​  Adds a polynomial conversion factor to the current command parameter  The conversion factor is applied to the value entered by the user before it is written into the binary command packet and sent.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredC0\tCoefficient\tTrue Cx\tAdditional coefficient values for the conversion. Any order polynomial conversion may be used so the value of 'x' will vary with the order of the polynomial. Note that larger order polynomials take longer to process than shorter order polynomials, but are sometimes more accurate.\tFalse  Example Usage:  POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION 10 0.5 0.25   SEG_POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION​  Adds a segmented polynomial conversion factor to the current command parameter  This conversion factor is applied to the value entered by the user before it is written into the binary command packet and sent.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredLower Bound\tDefines the lower bound of the range of values that this segmented polynomial applies to. Is ignored for the segment with the smallest lower bound.\tTrue C0\tCoefficient\tTrue Cx\tAdditional coefficient values for the conversion. Any order polynomial conversion may be used so the value of 'x' will vary with the order of the polynomial. Note that larger order polynomials take longer to process than shorter order polynomials, but are sometimes more accurate.\tFalse  Example Usage:  SEG_POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION 0 10 0.5 0.25 # Apply the conversion to all values &lt; 50 SEG_POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION 50 11 0.5 0.275 # Apply the conversion to all values &gt;= 50 and &lt; 100 SEG_POLY_WRITE_CONVERSION 100 12 0.5 0.3 # Apply the conversion to all values &gt;= 100   GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_START​  Start a generic write conversion  Adds a generic conversion function to the current command parameter. This conversion factor is applied to the value entered by the user before it is written into the binary command packet and sent. The conversion is specified as Ruby or Python code that receives two implied parameters. 'value' which is the raw value being written and 'packet' which is a reference to the command packet class (Note, referencing the packet as 'myself' is still supported for backwards compatibility). The last line of code should return the converted value. The GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_END keyword specifies that all lines of code for the conversion have been given.  Multiple write conversions on command parameters When a command is built, each item gets written (and write conversions are run) to set the default value. Then items are written (again write conversions are run) with user provided values. Thus write conversions can be run twice. Also there are no guarantees which parameters have already been written. The packet itself has a given_values() method which can be used to retrieve a hash of the user provided values to the command. That can be used to check parameter values passed in.  warning Generic conversions are not a good long term solution. Consider creating a conversion class and using WRITE_CONVERSION instead. WRITE_CONVERSION is easier to debug and higher performance.  Ruby Example:  APPEND_PARAMETER ITEM1 32 UINT 0 0xFFFFFFFF 0 GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_START return (value * 1.5).to_i # Convert the value by a scale factor GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_END   Python Example:  APPEND_PARAMETER ITEM1 32 UINT 0 0xFFFFFFFF 0 GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_START return int(value * 1.5) # Convert the value by a scale factor GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_END   GENERIC_WRITE_CONVERSION_END​  Complete a generic write conversion  OVERFLOW​  Set the behavior when writing a value overflows the type  By default OpenC3 throws an error if you try to write a value which overflows its specified type, e.g. writing 255 to a 8 bit signed value. Setting the overflow behavior also allows for OpenC3 to 'TRUNCATE' the value by eliminating any high order bits. You can also set 'SATURATE' which causes OpenC3 to replace the value with the maximum or minimum allowable value for that type. Finally you can specify 'ERROR_ALLOW_HEX' which will allow for a maximum hex value to be written, e.g. you can successfully write 255 to a 8 bit signed value.  Parameter\tDescription\tRequiredBehavior\tHow OpenC3 treats an overflow value. Only applies to signed and unsigned integer data types. Valid Values: ERROR, ERROR_ALLOW_HEX, TRUNCATE, SATURATE\tTrue  Example Usage:  OVERFLOW TRUNCATE   HIDDEN​  Indicates that the parameter should not be shown to the user in the Table Manager GUI  Hidden parameters still exist and will be saved to the resulting binary. This is useful for padding and other essential but non-user editable fields.  UNEDITABLE​  Indicates that the parameter should be shown to the user but not editable.  Uneditable parameters are useful for control fields which the user may be interested in but should not be able to edit.

In the example above you would set it to 172.20.0.9.port_tm is the port number on which cFS is sending the telemetry messages.port_tc indicates the port on cFS is listening for telecommands.  Under cfs_target_name you can change the target name of this plugin. This step is optional as long as you are fine with your plugin showing up as CFS.    Port subscription The last uploaded plugin on COSMOS will subscribe to TM on port 1235. Other plugins will not receive any TM anymore.  Typo errors Presence of typos in one of the plugin files can cause problems when uploading and installing the plugin's .gem file. Make sure your configuration is typo-free.  In the example above, the operator image is running at 172.20.0.8. To enable telemetry, go to the browser and connect tohttp://localhost:2900/tools/cmdsender/CFS/TO_LAB_ENABLE. Change the DEST_IP to the IP address of the operator image (172.20.0.8) and send the command.  Under http://localhost:2900/tools/cmdtlmserver/tlm-packets, you should see the incoming packets.

On a private network, it is anyone with access to that network.

This includes any modifications made, anything added, and all plugins. For web applications (like COSMOS), a link must be provided to all of the source code. There are some key implications of the above: You cannot keep anything proprietary from your users. They have the rights to take the code (and configuration) and do anything they want with it. You CANNOT impede these rights or you are violating the AGPLv3 and YOU lose the rights to use our software. You must provide a digital link to all source code for your users, including plugins.

You can also use a dual license similar to what we do indicating the AGPLv3 or a purchased OpenC3 Commercial license.  The AGPLv3 license is often chosen because it works well for open core products like COSMOS. Competitors cannot take the open source product and license it under different terms. They would be forever locked into the AGPLv3 which is difficult to monetize, because your customers can take any code you provide and publish it on the internet for free use by everyone.

These versions of Vue are not compatible with each other, so any tools written with Vue 2 will need to be updated. Additionally, our @openc3/tool-common NPM package has been deprecated with its functionality reorganized into two packages: @openc3/js-common and @openc3/vue-common. This is to provide a better experience for developers who are building COSMOS tools without the Vue framework.  We also removed a few rarely used API methods in COSMOS 6.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Updating Vue​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Upgrading","url":"/docs/getting-started/upgrading#updating-vue","content":" If your tool was not built with Vue (e.g. it was built without a frontend framework, or it was built with React, Angular, etc.), then you can skip this section.  The quick and dirty way​  Tools that are relatively simple can probably be upgraded in one shot by just updating the dependencies and fixing any build errors that arise, and then fixing any runtime errors you find from testing and using your tool. If you're confident in this upgrade path, you can reference this pull request to see what will need to change. Otherwise, the rest of this guide will walk you through a more in-depth and complete migration process.  Step 1: Vue compat mode​  The Vue team provided a compatibility mode to help with migrating from Vue 2 to Vue 3. This will let you get your tool up and running to make it easier to find the necessary changes.  (1.a) Update dependencies​  Use your package manager or edit the package.json file to update the following dependencies (ignore any packages marked &quot;Update&quot; that you aren't using)  Remove: vue-template-compilerAdd: @vue/compat &gt;= 3.5 (npmjs.com)Add: @vue/compiler-sfc &gt;= 3.5 (npmjs.com)Update: @vue/test-utils &gt;= 2.4 (npmjs.com)Update: vue &gt;= 3.5 (npmjs.com)Update: vuex &gt;= 4.1 (npmjs.com)Update: vue-router &gt;= 4.4 (npmjs.com)Update: vuetify &gt;= 3.7 (npmjs.com)Update: single-spa-vue &gt;= 3.0 (npmjs.com)  Eslint will help call out changes you'll need to make to your code for the migration, so it's recommended to include eslint in your project if you haven't already. There are plenty of guides online that will explain how to do that. If you're using eslint, then make the additional changes to your tool's dependencies:  Add: eslint-plugin-vuetify &gt;= 2.5 (npmjs.com)Add: vue-eslint-parser &gt;= 9.4 (npmjs.com)  If you modified your package.json file manually, don't forget to yarn or npm install at your project's root to apply the changes.  (1.b) Update the Vue config file (vue.config.js)​  You likely have a chainWebpack property in the object that's exported by this file which looks something like this (though your contents might vary)  chainWebpack: (config) =&gt; { config.module .rule('vue') .use('vue-loader') .tap((options) =&gt; { return { prettify: false, } }) },   Add a resolution alias for @vue/compat to the top of this block and set the compiler to use the Vue 2 compat mode:  chainWebpack: (config) =&gt; { config.resolve.alias.set('vue', '@vue/compat') // Add this line config.module .rule('vue') .use('vue-loader') .tap((options) =&gt; { return { prettify: false, compilerOptions: { // Add this block compatConfig: { // MODE: 2, // }, // }, // to here } }) },   (1.c) Update the eslint config file (.eslintrc)​  Find the string 'plugin:vue/essential' in your extends block and change it to 'plugin:vue/vue3-essential'. If you don't have that plugin in your extends block, or you're missing that block entirely, then add this. It will help find breaking changes in how your code is using the Vue API.  extends: [ 'plugin:vue/vue3-essential', // change this from plugin:vue/essential 'plugin:prettier/recommended', '@vue/prettier', ],   (1.d) Fix build and runtime warnings and errors​  Run your linting and build scripts (e.g. yarn lint and yarn build). The eslint plugin and Vue's compat mode will find the first set of code changes you need to address. Fix these lint/build errors until your project builds successfully.  Once it builds, run your project like you would for development. It's recommended to serve it from a local dev server with yarn serve and add it to the import map overrides in the browser. Test the functionality of your tool and address any Vue errors and warnings that get printed to the browser console in the dev tools. (NOTE: On MODE: 2 - your first pass through this section - it's ok if your tool doesn't completely work yet. Just address the warnings and errors that are logged to the browser console. You'll get your tool completely working in the next step.)  From our experience migrating the COSMOS first-party tools, you'll most likely have to make changes to your main.js and router.js files at a minimum. You can reference the PR mentioned above in the &quot;The quick and dirty way&quot; section above to see what we changed, or search the internet for Vue 2 -&gt; Vue 3 migration guides if you need help addressing any warnings or errors.  Step 2: Bump compat mode from 2 to 3​  Change the compatConfig you added to your vue config file (vue.config.js) from MODE: 2 to MODE: 3. This will tell Vue's compat mode that you've addressed the changes in the previous step, and it will find the next set of issues (since this is a multi-step process). Repeat the &quot;(1.d) Fix build and runtime warnings and errors&quot; step.  Step 3: Update Vuetify​  If you're not using Vuetify, you can skip this step.  Modify your eslint config (.eslintrc) again to add the Vuetify plugin:  extends: [ 'plugin:vue/vue3-essential', 'plugin:vuetify/base', // Add this line 'plugin:prettier/recommended', '@vue/prettier', ],   Note: The Vuetify eslint plugin is only designed for migrating projects from Vuetify 2 to Vuetify 3 and can cause linting performance issues, so it should be removed once your tool migration is complete.  Again in .eslintrc, find your parserOptions block and add the parser property above it:  parser: 'vue-eslint-parser', // Add this line parserOptions: { ... },   Now when you run eslint, it can tell you about any changes you'll need to address regarding how your code is using the Vuetify API. To find these changes, run eslint on your Vue files (e.g. yarn eslint . --ext .vue). You can address these manually, or if you trust eslint or have good version control, you can have the plugin fix most of them automatically with yarn eslint . --ext .vue --fix  Lastly, if you are using the Astro UXDS icons via Vuetify from COSMOS - or any custom icon packs for that matter - then you'll need to change their pack alias format from $packName- to packName:. Here's an example for the antenna-transmit Astro icon:  &lt;!-- Vue 2 / Vuetify 2 (old) --&gt; &lt;v-icon&gt; $astro-antenna-transmit &lt;/v-icon&gt; &lt;!-- Vue 3 / Vuetify 3 (new) --&gt; &lt;v-icon&gt; astro:antenna-transmit &lt;/v-icon&gt;   Step 4: Clean up​  Remove the @vue/compat and eslint-plugin-vuetify dependencies you added in step 1.aRemove the compatConfig you added in step 1.bRemove the 'plugin:vuetify/base' you added in step 3  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Migrating to the new OpenC3 common packages​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Upgrading","url":"/docs/getting-started/upgrading#migrating-to-the-new-openc3-common-packages","content":" As mentioned in the first paragraph of this guide, we've deprecated the @openc3/tool-common NPM package. All of its functionality has remained the same, but everything is organized differently, so you'll have to update your dependencies and imports.  Step 1: Update dependencies​  Use your package manager or edit the package.json file to update the following dependencies  Remove: @openc3/tool-commonAdd: @openc3/js-common &gt;= 6.0 (npmjs.com)Add: @openc3/vue-common &gt;= 6.0 (npmjs.com) This is only needed if you are using our Vue stuff (components, plugins, etc.)  Step 2: Update imports in your code​  In COSMOS 5, things were imported directly from @openc3/tool-common's src directory and subsequently built into your tool by your build process. Everything in COSMOS 6 is now exported through several top-level exports in our new common packages. In general, the pattern is as follows:  COSMOS 5: import bar from '@openc3/tool-common/src/foo/bar'COSMOS 6: import { bar } from '@openc3/vue-common/foo'  This pattern also lets you combine multiple import statements into one (e.g. import { bar, baz } from '@openc3/vue-common/foo').  There are three exceptions to this pattern:  Widgets are no longer under the components directory but instead get their own top-level export Old: import foo from '@openc3/tool-common/src/components/widgets/FooNew: import { foo } from '@openc3/vue-common/widgets Icons got the same treatment Old: import bar from '@openc3/tool-common/src/components/icons/BarNew: import { bar } from '@openc3/vue-common/icons The TimeFilters mixin was moved from tools/base to util Old: import TimeFilters from '@openc3/tool-common/src/tools/base/util/timeFiltersNew: import { TimeFilters } from '@openc3/vue-common/util  @openc3/js-common​  This package contains things previously under @openc3/tool-common/src/services. Anything not from that path will be in the vue-common package discussed below.  Update any of your imports from that path accordingly. Here's an example:  // COSMOS 5 (old) import Api from &quot;@openc3/tool-common/src/services/api&quot;; import Cable from &quot;@openc3/tool-common/src/services/cable&quot;; import { OpenC3Api } from &quot;@openc3/tool-common/src/services/openc3Api&quot;; // COSMOS 6 (new) import { Api, Cable, OpenC3Api } from &quot;@openc3/js-common/services&quot;;   This package also provides a couple more top-level imports which you likely will not need, but they might be useful, so I'll call them out here:  import { prependBasePath } from '@openc3/js-common/utils provides a function that will prepend the base path (e.g. localhost:2900) to Vue Router route objects and their children. This can be useful if you run into certain quirks with single-spa and vue-router 4's routing logic where you need the full path. You can see how we use it here. import { devServerPlugin } from '@openc3/js-common/viteDevServerPlugin. This Vite plugin is a temporary hack to run a local dev server for tools when migrating from webpack/vue-cli. It should be replaced with Vite's built-in vite dev dev server, but that's currently not working - at least in our first-party COSMOS tools. You can see how we use it here.  @openc3/vue-common​  This package provides all the shared Vue components we use to build our first-party tools. The main top-level exports are components, icons, plugins, util, and widgets. There are also some tool-specific exports that we built for code sharing with COSMOS Enterprise, which you might find useful: tool/base, tool/admin, and tool/calendar. Here's an example, but again, reference the pattern mentioned above.  // COSMOS 5 (old) import DetailsDialog from &quot;@openc3/tool-common/src/components/DetailsDialog&quot;; import Graph from &quot;@openc3/tool-common/src/components/Graph&quot;; import Notify from &quot;@openc3/tool-common/src/plugins/notify&quot;; import TimeFilters from &quot;@openc3/tool-common/src/tools/base/util/timeFilters&quot;; import VWidget from &quot;@openc3/tool-common/src/components/widgets/VWidget&quot;; // COSMOS 6 (new) import { DetailsDialog, Graph } from &quot;@openc3/vue-common/components&quot;; import { Notify } from &quot;@openc3/vue-common/plugins&quot;; import { TimeFilters } from &quot;@openc3/vue-common/util&quot;; import { VWidget } from &quot;@openc3/vue-common/widgets&quot;;   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Migrating From COSMOS 4 to COSMOS 5​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Upgrading","url":"/docs/getting-started/upgrading#migrating-from-cosmos-4-to-cosmos-5","content":" All COSMOS Users All COSMOS 4 users must upgrade their configuration to 5.

PORT is used to declare the port(s) that your microservice is listening for connections on. This is used in combination with ROUTE_PREFIX to create a dynamic traefik route to your microservice.  The following code is used internally to let traefik know where to connect to your microservice internally:  if ENV['OPENC3_OPERATOR_HOSTNAME'] url = &quot;http://#{ENV['OPENC3_OPERATOR_HOSTNAME']}:#{port}&quot; else if ENV['KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST'] url = &quot;http://#{microservice_name.downcase.gsub('__', '-').gsub('_', '-')}-service:#{port}&quot; else url = &quot;http://openc3-operator:#{port}&quot; end end   Note that this is the internal route to your microservice. Determining this route checks two different environment variables.  OPENC3_OPERATOR_HOSTNAME is used to override the default service name for our regular docker compose operator of &quot;openc3-operator&quot;. Usually this is not set.  In OpenC3 Enterprise, KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST is used to detect if we are running in a Kubernetes environment (it will be set by Kubernetes), in which case the service is expected to have a Kubernetes service named scope-user-microservicename-service. For example, if you are using the DEFAULT scope and have a microservice named MYMICROSERVICE the service would be found at the hostname: default-user-mymicroservice-service. Double underscores or single underscores are replaced by a dash and the name is all lower case.  ROUTE_PREFIX is used to define the external route. The external route will take the form of http(s)://YOURCOSMOSDOMAIN:PORT/ROUTE_PREFIX. So for example, if you set the ROUTE_PREFIX to /mymicroservice then on a default local installation, it could be reached at http://localhost:2900/mymicroservice. The http://localhost:2900 part should be substituted by whatever domain you are accessing COSMOS at.  Here is a snippet of code showing PORT and ROUTE_PREFIX in use within a plugin.txt file:  VARIABLE cfdp_microservice_name CFDP VARIABLE cfdp_route_prefix /cfdp VARIABLE cfdp_port 2905 MICROSERVICE CFDP &lt;%= cfdp_microservice_name %&gt; WORK_DIR . ROUTE_PREFIX &lt;%= cfdp_route_prefix %&gt; PORT &lt;%= cfdp_port %&gt;   Leaving the variables at their default values the following will occur:  The microservice will be exposed internally to Docker (Open Source or Enterprise) at: http://openc3-operator:2905The microservice will be exposed internally to Kubernetes (Enterprise) at: http://default-user-cfdp-service:2905The microservice will be exposed externally to the network at: http://localhost:2900/cfdp  The same can be done for INTERFACE but note that the Kubernetes service name will use the microservice name of the interface which takes the form of SCOPE__INTERFACE__INTERFACENAME.  Here is an example using PORT and ROUTE_PREFIX with INTERFACE:  VARIABLE my_interface_name MY_INT VARIABLE my_route_prefix /myint VARIABLE my_port 2910 INTERFACE &lt;%= my_interface_name %&gt; http_server_interface.rb &lt;%= my_port %&gt; ROUTE_PREFIX &lt;%= my_route_prefix %&gt; PORT &lt;%= my_port %&gt;   The interface will be exposed internally to Docker (Open Source or Enterprise) at: http://openc3-operator:2910The interface will be exposed internally to Kubernetes (Enterprise) at: http://default-interface-my-int-service:2905The interface will be exposed externally to the network at: http://localhost:2900/myint  Sharded Operator on Kubernetes (Enterprise) The sharded operator is expected to be used on Kubernetes whenever the Kubernetes Operator is not used. Typically this will be because the user does not have permission to use the Kubernetes API directly to spawn containers which is required for use of the Kubernetes Operator. In this case, Kubernetes services will NOT be automatically created, and will have to be manually created by a user with permissions in Kubernetes, or through some other authorized method (like a custom framework dashboard or config file).

This means that COSMOS adapts to what other systems are doing and evolves over time. It does not publish an API that hardware must adhere to if it wants to communicate with COSMOS. Log Everything All data that flows into and out of COSMOS is logged. This provides history as well as attribution for what happened when and why. Keeping accurate logs is an essential and critical aspect of COSMOS. Open Architecture and Source Nothing about how COSMOS is implemented is meant to be secret or hidden, even in Enterprise Edition. In all editions, the source code for everything in COSMOS is provided and available for users to inspect or modify as needed. Never worry about an unsolvable problem or having to accept some detail that you don't like. This also opens the world to integrate anything they need into COSMOS without restriction or limitation. Be Modular There are infinite number of things for COSMOS to connect to, but it is impossible to ship COSMOS with all the code it would need to talk to everything. For this reason, COSMOS is designed to be modular in all the places that matter.

On all platforms the key performance factor is the number and complexity of the targets and their defined packets. Targets can vary from simple targets taking 100 MB of RAM to complex targets taking 400 MB. The base COSMOS containers require about 800 MB of RAM. A good rule of thumb is to average about 300 MB of RAM for targets. As an example data point, the COSMOS Demo has 4 targets, two complex (INST &amp; INST2) and two relatively simple (EXAMPLE &amp; TEMPLATED), and requires 800 MB of RAM (on top of the 800 MB of base container RAM).  Base RAM MB Calculator = 800 + (num targets) * 300  In addition, the Redis streams contain the last 10 min of both raw and decommutated data from all targets. Thus you must wait ~15min to truly see what the high water memory mark will be. In the COSMOS Demo the INST &amp; INST2 targets are fairly simple with four 1Hz packet of ~15 items and one 10Hz packet with 20 items. This only causes 50 MiB of redis RAM usage according to docker stats. Installing the COSMOS LoadSim with 10 packets with 1000 items each at 10Hz pushed the redis memory usage to about 350 MiB.

In the Open Source Edition, by default COSMOS spawns off 2 microservices per target. One combines packet logging and decommutation of the data and the other performs data reduction. In COSMOS Enterprise Edition on Kubernetes, each process becomes an independent container that is deployed on the cluster allowing horizontal scaling.  The COSMOS command and telemetry API and script running API servers should have a dedicated core while targets can generally share cores. It's hard to provide a general rule of thumb with the wide variety of architectures, clock speeds, and core counts. The best practice is to install COSMOS with the expected load and do some monitoring with htop to visualize the load on the various cores. Any time a single core gets overloaded (100%) this is a concern and system slowdown can occur.

Sizing can be approximated but the best solution is to install representative targets and use docker stats and htop to judge the CPU and memory pressure on the given hardware.  COSMOS Enterprise Edition on Kubernetes helps to eliminate the hardware sizing issue by scaling the cluster to meet the needs of the system. Check out this recent talk Ryan gave at GSAW showing how we scaled to over 160 satellites on a 4 node kubernetes cluster on EKS.

The main thread will block on the web socket to listen to request changes to the timeline, these could be adding, removing, or updating activities. The main thread will make the changes to the in memory schedule if these changes are within the hour of the current time. When the web socket gets an update it has an action lookup table. These actions are &quot;created&quot;, &quot;updated&quot;, &quot;deleted&quot;, etc... Some actions require updating the schedule from the database to ensure the schedule and the database are always in sync.  The schedule thread checks every second to make sure if a task can be run. If the start time is equal or less then the last 15 seconds it will then check the previously queued jobs list in the schedule. If the activity has not been queued and is not fulfilled the activity will be queued, this adds an event to the activity but is not saved to the database.  The workers block on the queue until an activity is placed on the queue. Once a job is pulled from the queue they check the type and run the activity. The thread will mark the activity fulfillment true and update the database record with the complete. If the worker gets an error while trying to run the task the activity will NOT be fulfilled and record the error in the database.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Triggers​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Autonomic (Enterprise)","url":"/docs/tools/autonomic#triggers","content":" Triggers are logical components that are evaluated to true or false. Creating a trigger is like specifying an equation to evaluate. The trigger creation dialog specifies the Trigger Group which owns the trigger and the &quot;left operand&quot;. This can be a telemetry item or an existing trigger.    Once you've chosen the &quot;left operand&quot; you need to choose the operator.    Finally you choose the &quot;right operand&quot; which in this case is a simple value.    After the trigger is created it is displayed in Autonomic and waits to be activated by the given logic. Active triggers are highlighted in the list.    Triggers can also be manually disabled and enabled by clicking the plug icon.    Note in the above screenshot the Events which track everything about the trigger.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Reactions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Autonomic (Enterprise)","url":"/docs/tools/autonomic#reactions","content":" Reactions wait for triggers to be evaluated to true and perform actions such as sending a command or running a script. Reactions can not exist without a corresponding trigger. The reaction creation dialog specifies whether to treat the trigger as an Edge or Level. It then allows you to select which trigger(s) the reaction will react to. Selecting multiple triggers allows any of the triggers to trigger the reaction (Note: Creating a reaction which responds to Trigger A AND Trigger B is done by creating additional triggers).    After the triggers are specified, the dialog prompts for the actions to take. You can either send a command, run a script, or simply push a notification. Commands and scripts can also optionally push a notification. In this example a script is specified with a notification at the WARN level.  Spawning Scripts Be aware of how and when you spawn scripts and whether they are running to completion. Spawning a faulty script can lead to many unfinished scripts consuming resources.    Finally the snooze setting is specified. Snooze is the number of seconds after the reaction runs before the reaction will be allowed to run again. This is especially important in Level triggers where if the trigger remains active the reaction can run continuously.    Once the reaction is created it is listed in the interface.    When the reaction runs the &quot;State&quot; changes to the snooze icon and the &quot;Snooze Until&quot; is updated to indicate the reaction is waiting before being allowed to run again.

Items with limits values are displayed using a red yellow green limits bar displaying where the current value lies within the defined limits (as shown by the various TEMP items). Items with yellow or red states are simply displayed with their state color (as shown by GROUND1STATUS). The COSMOS Demo contains both INST HEALTH_STATUS TEMP2 and INST2 HEALTH_STATUS TEMP2 which are identically named items within different target packets. Limits Monitor only displays the item name to save space, however if you mouse over the value box the full target and packet name is displayed.  Clicking the first nested 'X' icon ignores the entire packet where the item resides. Any additional items in that packet which go out of limits are also ignored by Limits Monitor. Clicking the second (middle) 'X' ignores ONLY that specific item. If any packets or items are ignored the Overall Limits State is updated to indicate &quot;(Some items ignored)&quot; to indicate the Limits State is potentially being affected by ignored items.  Clicking the last icon (eye with strike-through) temporarily hides the specified item. This is different from ignoring an item because if this item goes out of limits it will be again be displayed. Hiding an item is useful if the item has gone back to green and you want to continue to track it but want to clean up the current list of items. For example, we might hide the GROUND1STATUS items in the above example as they have transitioned back to green.

See the example in CHECKBUTTON.  Button code can get rather complex so remember to use string concatenation to make things more readable. If you use + newlines are inserted automatically during string concatenation. If you use \\ you'll need to separate lines with a single semicolon ;.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Ruby vs Python in COSMOS​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Script Writing Guide","url":"/docs/guides/script-writing#ruby-vs-python-in-cosmos","content":" There are many similarities and a few key differences between Ruby and Python when it comes to writing COSMOS scripts.  There is no 80 character limit on line length. Lines can be as long as you like, but be careful to not make them too long as it makes printed reviews of scripts more difficult.Indentation white space: Ruby: Not significant. Ruby uses the end keyword to determine indented code blocks with a standard of 2 spaces.Python: Significant. Python uses indentation to determine code blocks with a standard of 4 spaces. Variables do not have to be declared ahead of time and can be reassigned later, i.e. Ruby and Python are dynamically typed.Variable interpolation: Ruby: Variable values can be placed into strings using the &quot;#{variable}&quot; syntax.Python: Variable values can be placed into f-strings using the f&quot;{variable}&quot; syntax. A variable declared inside of a block or loop will not exist outside of that block unless it was already declared.  Both languages provides a script writer a lot of power. But with great power comes great responsibility. Remember when writing your scripts that you or someone else will come along later and need to understand them. Therefore use the following style guidelines:  Use consistent spacing for indentation and do NOT use tabsConstants should be all caps with underscores SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299792458 # meters per s Variable names and method names should be in lowercase with underscores last_name = &quot;Smith&quot;perform_setup_operation() Class names (when used) should be camel case and the files which contain them should match but be lowercase with underscores class DataUploader # in 'data_uploader.rb'class CcsdsUtility: # in 'ccsds_utility.py' Don't add useless comments but instead describe intent    The following is an example of good Ruby style:  load 'TARGET/lib/upload_utility.rb' # library we do NOT want to show executing load_utility 'TARGET/lib/helper_utility.rb' # library we do want to show executing # Declare constants OUR_TARGETS = ['INST','INST2'] # Clear the collect counter of the passed in target name def clear_collects(target) cmd(&quot;#{target} CLEAR&quot;) wait_check(&quot;#{target} HEALTH_STATUS COLLECTS == 0&quot;, 5) end ###################################### # START ###################################### helper = HelperUtility.new helper.setup # Perform collects on all the targets OUR_TARGETS.each do |target| collects = tlm(&quot;#{target} HEALTH_STATUS COLLECTS&quot;) cmd(&quot;#{target} COLLECT with TYPE SPECIAL&quot;) wait_check(&quot;#{target} HEALTH_STATUS COLLECTS == #{collects + 1}&quot;, 5) end clear_collects('INST') clear_collects('INST2')   The following is an example of good Python style:  from openc3.script import * import TARGET.lib.upload_utility # library we do NOT want to show executing load_utility('TARGET/lib/helper_utility.rb') # library we do want to show executing # Declare constants OUR_TARGETS = ['INST','INST2'] # Clear the collect counter of the passed in target name def clear_collects(target): cmd(f&quot;{target} CLEAR&quot;) wait_check(f&quot;{target} HEALTH_STATUS COLLECTS == 0&quot;, 5) ###################################### # START ###################################### helper = HelperUtility() helper.setup() # Perform collects on all the targets for target in OUR_TARGETS: collects = tlm(f&quot;{target} HEALTH_STATUS COLLECTS&quot;) cmd(f&quot;{target} COLLECT with TYPE SPECIAL&quot;) wait_check(f&quot;{target} HEALTH_STATUS COLLECTS == {collects + 1}&quot;, 5) clear_collects('INST') clear_collects('INST2')   Both examples shows several features of COSMOS scripting in action. Notice the difference between 'load' or 'import' and 'load_utility'. The first is to load additional scripts which will NOT be shown in Script Runner when executing. This is a good place to put code which takes a long time to run such as image analysis or other looping code where you just want the output. 'load_utility' will visually execute the code line by line to show the user what is happening.  Next we declare our constants and create an array of strings which we store in OUR_TARGETS. Notice the constant is all uppercase with underscores.  Then we declare our local methods of which we have one called clear_collects. Please provide a comment at the beginning of each method describing what it does and the parameters that it takes.  The 'helper_utility' is then created. Note the similarity in the class name and the file name we loaded.  The collect example shows how you can iterate over the array of strings we previously created and use variables when commanding and checking telemetry. The Ruby pound bracket # notation and python f-string f&quot; notation puts whatever the variable holds into the string. You can even execute additional code inside the brackets like we do when checking for the collect count to increment.  Finally we call our 'clear_collects' method on each target by passing the target name.

In extreme cases, this has led to 100,000+ line scripts that are impossible to maintain and review.  There are two common ways repetition presents itself: exact blocks of code to perform a common action such as powering on a subsystem, and blocks of code that only differ in the name of the mnemonic being checked or the values checked against. Both are solved by removing the repetition using methods (or functions).  For example, a script that powers on a subsystem and ensures correct telemetry would become:  Ruby:  def power_on_subsystem # 100 lines of cmd(), wait_check(), etc end   Python:  def power_on_subsystem(): # 100 lines of cmd(), wait_check(), etc   Ideally, the above methods would be stored in another file where it could be used by other scripts. If it is truly only useful in the one script, then it could be at the top of the file. The updated script would then look like:  power_on_subsystem() # 150 lines operating the subsystem (e.g.) # cmd(...) # wait_check(...) #... power_off_subystem() # Unrelated activities power_on_subsystem() # etc.   Blocks of code where only the only variation is the mnemonics or values checked can be replaced by methods with arguments.

Script Runner provides both a script execution environment and a script editor. The script editor includes code completion for both COSMOS methods and command/telemetry item names. It is also a great environment to develop and test scripts. Script Runner provides a framework for users that are familiar with a traditional scripting model with longer style procedures, and for users that want to be able to edit their scripts in place.  When opening a suite file (named with 'suite') Script Runner provides a more formal, but also more powerful, environment for running scripts. Suite files breaks scripts down into suites, groups, and scripts (individual methods). Suites are the highest-level concept and would typically cover a large procedure such as a thermal vacuum test, or a large operations scenario such as performing on orbit checkout. Groups capture a related set of scripts such as all the scripts regarding a specific mechanism. A Group might be a collection of scripts all related to a subsystem, or a specific series of tests such as an RF checkout. Scripts capture individual activities that can either pass or fail. Script Runner allows for running an entire suite, one or more groups, or one or more scripts easily. It also automatically produces reports containing timing, pass / fail counts, etc.  The correct environment for the job is up to individual users, and many programs will use both script formats to complete their goals.

However, they can make restarting a COSMOS script at the point of a failure difficult or impossible. If there is a low probability of something failing, then loops are an excellent choice. If a script is running a loop over a list of telemetry points, it may be a better choice to “unroll” the loop by making the loop body into a method, and then calling that method directly for each iteration of a loop that would have occurred.  Ruby:  10.times do |temperature_number| check_temperature(temperature_number + 1) end   Python:  for temperature_number in range(1, 11): check_temperature(temperature_number)   If the above script was stopped after temperature number 3, there would be no way to restart the loop at temperature number 4.

This means that each line has some extra code added behind the scenes that primarily highlights the current executing line and catches exceptions if things fail such as a wait_check. If your script needs to use code in other files, there are a few ways to bring in that code. Some techniques bring in instrumented code and others bring in uninstrumented code. There are reasons to use both.  load_utility (and the deprecated require_utility), bring in instrumented code from other files. When COSMOS runs the code in the other file, Script Runner will dive into the other file and show each line highlighted as it executes. This should be the default way to bring in other files, as it allows continuing if something fails, and provides better visibility to operators.  However, sometimes you don't want to display code executing from other files. Externally developed libraries generally do not like to be instrumented, and code that contains large loops or that just takes a long time to execute when highlighting lines, will be much faster if included in a method that does not instrument lines. Ruby provides two ways to bring in uninstrumented code. The first is the “load” keyword. Load will bring in the code from another file and will bring in any changes to the file if it is updated on the next call to load. “require” is like load but is optimized to only bring in the code from another file once. Therefore, if you use require and then change the file it requires, you must restart Script Runner to re-require the file and bring in the changes. In general, load is recommended over require for COSMOS scripting. One gotcha with load is that it requires the full filename including extension, while the require keyword does not.  In Python, libraries are included using the import syntax. Any code imported using import is not instrumented. Only the code imported using load_utility is instrumented.  Finally, COSMOS scripting has a special syntax for disabling instrumentation in the middle of an instrumented script, with the disable_instrumentation method. This allows you to disable instrumentation for large loops and other activities that are too slow when running instrumented.  Ruby:  temp = 0 disable_instrumentation do # Make sure nothing in here will raise exceptions! 5000000.times do temp += 1 end end puts temp   Python:  temp = 0 with disable_instrumentation(): # Make sure nothing in here will raise exceptions! for x in range(0,5000000): temp += 1 print(temp)   When Running Uninstrumented Code Make sure that the code will not raise any exceptions or have any check failures. If an exception is raised from uninstrumented code, then your entire script will stop.

Ruby:  answer = ask_string(&quot;Do you want to continue (y/n)?&quot;) if answer != 'y' and answer != 'Y' raise &quot;User entered: #{answer}&quot; end temp = 0.0 while temp &lt; 10.0 or temp &gt; 50.0 temp = ask(&quot;Enter the desired temperature between 10.0 and 50.0&quot;) end   Python:  answer = ask_string(&quot;Do you want to continue (y/n)?&quot;) if answer != 'y' and answer != 'Y': raise RuntimeError(f&quot;User entered: {answer}&quot;) temp = 0.0 while temp &lt; 10.0 or temp &gt; 50.0: temp = ask(&quot;Enter the desired temperature between 10.0 and 50.0&quot;)   When possible, always use one of the other user input methods that has a constrained list of choices for your users (message_box, vertical_message_box, combo_box).

A common mistake is to check a variable like so (Ruby variable interpolation):  check_expression(&quot;#{answer} == 'yes'&quot;) # where answer contains 'yes'  This evaluates to yes == 'yes' which is not valid syntax because the variable yes is not defined (usually). The correct way to write this expression is as follows:  check_expression(&quot;'#{answer}' == 'yes'&quot;) # where answer contains 'yes'  Now this evaluates to 'yes' == 'yes' which is true so the check passes.  Ruby Syntax:  check_expression(exp_to_eval, context = nil)   Python Syntax:  check_expression(exp_to_eval, globals=None, locals=None)   Parameter\tDescriptionexp_to_eval\tAn expression to evaluate. context (ruby only)\tThe context to call eval with. Defaults to nil. Context in Ruby is typically binding() and is usually not needed. globals (python only)\tThe globals to call eval with. Defaults to None. Note that to use COSMOS APIs like tlm() you must pass globals(). locals (python only)\tThe locals to call eval with. Defaults to None. Note that if you're using local variables in a method you must pass locals().  Ruby Example:  check_expression(&quot;tlm('INST HEALTH_STATUS COLLECTS') &gt; 5 and tlm('INST HEALTH_STATUS TEMP1') &gt; 25.0&quot;)   Python Example:  def check(value): # Here we using both tlm() and a local 'value' so we need to pass globals() and locals() check_expression(&quot;tlm('INST HEALTH_STATUS COLLECTS') &gt; value&quot;, 5, 0.25, globals(), locals()) check(5)   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"check_exception​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Scripting API Guide","url":"/docs/guides/scripting-api#check_exception","content":" Executes a method and expects an exception to be raised.
