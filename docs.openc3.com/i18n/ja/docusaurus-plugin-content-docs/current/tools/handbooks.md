## Introduction

Handbooks formats the COSMOS [command](../configuration/command.md) and [telemetry](../configuration/telemetry.md) definitions into a nicely formatted webpage that can be exported to a PDF.

You can select the targets you want to display and the number of columns to display on the page. You can then use the browser to Print the page. Most browsers have the capability to Save as PDF rather than print to save the resulting page as PDF.
