## Introduction

Data Extractor extracts command and telemetry items into comma or tab separated files. Individual items or entire packets can be processed over any time period. Data Extractor also has a number of options to control the output for post processing in Excel or Matlab, for example.

## Selecting Items for Output

### Start/End Date/Time

Data Extractor provides text fields where you specify the time range to extract items. Clicking the Start Date and End Date text fields opens a Date Chooser dialog. Note you can also manually type in the date. Clicking the Start Time and End Time icon opens up a Time Chooser dialog. Note you can also manually type in the time.

### Adding Target(s) Packet(s) Item(s)

Data Extractor provides Target, Packet, Item drop downs to select the items you want to export. When you select a Target the Packet drop down defaults to \[All\] which sets the button to "Add Target". This would add EVERY item defined in EVERY packet in the target. Note: This can be a LOT of telemetry points but any added point can be removed.

When you select a Packet the Item drop down defaults to \[All\] which sets the button to "Add Packet". This would add EVERY item defined in the specified packet. Note: This can be a LOT of telemetry points but any added point can be removed.

When you select an individual Item the button changes to "Add Item" and the Description field updates with the item's description.
