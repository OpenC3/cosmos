## Overview

Interfaces are the connection to the external embedded systems called [targets](target). Interfaces are defined by the top level [INTERFACE](plugins.md#interface-1) keyword in the plugin.txt file.

Interface classes provide the code that COSMOS uses to receive real-time telemetry from targets and to send commands to targets. The interface that a target uses could be anything (TCP/IP, serial, MQTT, SNMP, etc.), therefore it is important that this is a customizable portion of any reusable Command and Telemetry System. Fortunately the most common form of interfaces are over TCP/IP sockets, and COSMOS provides interface solutions for these. This guide will discuss how to use these interface classes, and how to create your own. Note that in most cases you can extend interfaces with [Protocols](protocols.md) rather than implementing a new interface.

:::info Interface and Routers Are Very Similar
Note that Interfaces and Routers are very similar and share the same configuration parameters. Routers are simply Interfaces which route an existing Interface's telemetry data out to the connected target and routes the connected target's commands back to the original Interface's target.
:::

### Protocols

Protocols define the behaviour of an Interface, including differentiating packet boundaries and modifying data as necessary. See [Protocols](protocols) for more information.

### Accessors

Accessors are responsible for reading and writing the buffer which is transmitted by the interface to the target. See [Accessors](accessors) for more information.

For more information about how Interfaces fit with Protocols and Accessors see [Interoperability Without Standards](https://www.openc3.com/news/interoperability-without-standards).

## Provided Interfaces

COSMOS provides the following interfaces: TCPIP Client, TCPIP Server, UDP, HTTP Client, HTTP Server, MQTT and Serial. The interface to use is defined by the [INTERFACE](plugins.md#interface) and [ROUTER](plugins.md#router) keywords. See [Interface Modifiers](plugins.md#interface-modifiers) for a description of the keywords which can follow the INTERFACE keyword.

COSMOS Enterprise provides the following interfaces: SNMP, SNMP Trap, GEMS, InfluxDB.

#### All Interface Options

The following options apply to all interfaces. Options are added directly beneath the interface definition as shown in the example.

| Option       | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PERIODIC_CMD | Command to send at periodic intervals. Takes 3 parameters: LOG/DONT_LOG, the interval in seconds, and the actual command to send as a string. |

Examples:

```ruby
INTERFACE INTERFACE_NAME tcpip_client_interface.rb host.docker.internal 8080 8080 10.0 10.0
  # Send the 'INST ABORT' command every 5s and don't log in the CmdTlmServer messages

  OPTION PERIODIC_CMD LOG 10.0 "INST2 COLLECT with TYPE NORMAL"
```

| Option      | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CONNECT_CMD | Command to send when the interface connects. Takes 2 parameters: LOG/DONT_LOG and the actual command to send as a string. |

Examples:

```ruby

  # Send the 'INST ABORT' command on connection and don't log in the CmdTlmServer messages
  # Note that all commands are logged in the binary logs
  OPTION CONNECT_CMD DONT_LOG "INST ABORT"
INTERFACE INTERFACE_NAME openc3/interfaces/tcpip_client_interface.py host.docker.internal 8080 8080 10.0 10.0

  OPTION CONNECT_CMD LOG "INST2 COLLECT with TYPE NORMAL"
```

### TCPIP Client Interface

The TCPIP client interface connects to a TCPIP socket to send commands and receive telemetry. This interface is used for targets which open a socket and wait for a connection. This is the most common type of interface.

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                    | Required |

### TCPIP Server Interface

The TCPIP server interface creates a TCPIP server which listens for incoming connections and dynamically creates sockets which communicate with the target. This interface is used for targets which open a socket and try to connect to a server.

NOTE: To receive connections from outside the internal docker network you need to expose the TCP port in the compose.yaml file. For example, to allow connections on port 8080 find the openc3-operator section and modify like the following example:

```yaml
openc3-operator:
  ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080" # Open tcp port 8080
```

| Parameter          | Description                                                                           | Required |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Write Port         | Port to write commands to (can be the same as read port)                              | Yes      |
| Read Port          | Port to read telemetry from (can be the same as write port)                           | Yes      |
| Write Timeout      | Number of seconds to wait before aborting the write                                   | Yes      |
| Read Timeout       | Number of seconds to wait before aborting the read. Pass nil / None to block on read. | Yes      |
| Protocol Type      | See Protocols.                                                                        | No       |
| Protocol Arguments | See Protocols for the arguments each stream protocol takes.                           | No       |

#### Interface Options

Options are added directly beneath the interface definition as shown in the example.

| Option         | Description                         | Default |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------- |

```

### UDP Interface

The UDP interface uses UDP packets to send and receive telemetry from the target.

NOTE: To receive UDP packets from outside the internal docker network you need to expose the UDP port in the compose.yaml file. For example, to allow UDP packets on port 8081 find the openc3-operator section and modify like the following example:

```yaml
openc3-operator:
  ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:8081:8081/udp" # Open udp port 8081
```

### HTTP Client Interface

The HTTP client interface connects to a HTTP server to send commands and receive telemetry. This interface is commonly used with the [HttpAccessor](accessors#http-accessor) and [JsonAccessor](accessors#json-accessor). See the [openc3-cosmos-http-example](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/tree/main/examples/openc3-cosmos-http-example) for more information.

```

### HTTP Server Interface

The HTTP server interface creates a simple unencrypted, unauthenticated HTTP server. This interface is commonly used with the [HttpAccessor](accessors#http-accessor) and [JsonAccessor](accessors#json-accessor). See the [openc3-cosmos-http-example](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/tree/main/examples/openc3-cosmos-http-example) for more information.

```

### MQTT Interface

The MQTT interface is typically used for connecting to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The COSMOS MQTT interface is a client that can both publish and receive messages (commands and telemetry). It has built in support for SSL certificates as well as authentication. It differs from the MQTT Streaming Interface in that the commands and telemetry are transmitted over topics given by `META TOPIC` in the command and telemetry definitions.

| Parameter | Description                                                                          | Required | Default |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------- |
| Host      | Host name or IP address of the MQTT broker                                           | Yes      |         |
| Port      | Port on the MQTT broker to connect to. Keep in mind whether you're using SSL or not. | No       | 1883    |

#### Interface Options

Options are added directly beneath the interface definition as shown in the example.

| Option           | Description                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ACK_TIMEOUT      | Time to wait when connecting to the MQTT broker                                            |
| USERNAME         | Username for authentication with the MQTT broker                                           |

plugin.txt Ruby Example:

```ruby
INTERFACE MQTT_INT mqtt_interface.rb test.mosquitto.org 1883
```

plugin.txt Python Example (Note: This example uses the [SECRET](plugins#secret) keyword to set the PASSWORD option in the Interface):

```ruby
INTERFACE MQTT_INT openc3/interfaces/mqtt_interface.py test.mosquitto.org 8884
  OPTION USERNAME rw
  # Create an env variable called MQTT_PASSWORD with the secret named PASSWORD
  # and set an OPTION called PASSWORD with the secret value
  # For more information about secrets see the Admin Tool page
  SECRET ENV PASSWORD MQTT_PASSWORD PASSWORD
```

#### Packet Definitions

The MQTT Interface utilizes 'META TOPIC &lt;topic name&gt;' in the command and telemetry definition files to determine which topics to publish and receive messages from. Thus to send to the topic 'TEST' you would create a command like the following (Note: The command name 'TEST' does NOT have to match the topic name):

```
COMMAND MQTT TEST BIG_ENDIAN "Test"
  META TOPIC TEST # <- The topic name is 'TEST'
  APPEND_PARAMETER DATA 0 BLOCK '' "MQTT Data"
```

Similarly to receive from the topic 'TEST' you would create a telemetry packet like the following (Note: The telemetry name 'TEST' does NOT have to match the topic name):

```
TELEMETRY MQTT TEST BIG_ENDIAN "Test"
  META TOPIC TEST # <- The topic name is 'TEST'

### MQTT Streaming Interface

The MQTT streaming interface is typically used for connecting to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The COSMOS MQTT streaming interface is a client that can both publish and receive messages (commands and telemetry). It has built in support for SSL certificates as well as authentication. It differs from the MQTT Interface in that all the commands are transmitted on a single topic and all telemetry is received on a single topic.

plugin.txt Ruby Example:

```ruby
INTERFACE MQTT_INT mqtt_stream_interface.rb test.mosquitto.org 1883 false write read
```

plugin.txt Python Example (Note: This example uses the [SECRET](plugins#secret) keyword to set the PASSWORD option in the Interface):

```ruby
INTERFACE MQTT_INT openc3/interfaces/mqtt_stream_interface.py test.mosquitto.org 8884 False write read
  OPTION USERNAME rw
  # Create an env variable called MQTT_PASSWORD with the secret named PASSWORD
  # and set an OPTION called PASSWORD with the secret value
  # For more information about secrets see the Admin Tool page
  SECRET ENV PASSWORD MQTT_PASSWORD PASSWORD
```

#### Packet Definitions

The MQTT Streaming Interface utilizes the topic names passed to the interface so no additional information is necessary in the definition.

## Custom Interfaces

Interfaces have the following methods that must be implemented:

1. **connect** - Open the socket or port or somehow establish the connection to the target. Note: This method may not block indefinitely. Be sure to call super() in your implementation.
1. **connected?** - Return true or false depending on the connection state. Note: This method should return immediately.
1. **disconnect** - Close the socket or port of somehow disconnect from the target. Note: This method may not block indefinitely. Be sure to call super() in your implementation.
1. **read_interface** - Lowest level read of data on the interface. Note: This method should block until data is available or the interface disconnects. On a clean disconnect it should return nil.
1. **write_interface** - Lowest level write of data on the interface. Note: This method may not block indefinitely.

Interfaces also have the following methods that exist and have default implementations. They can be overridden if necessary but be sure to call super() to allow the default implementation to be executed.

1. **read_interface_base** - This method should always be called from read_interface(). It updates interface specific variables that are displayed by CmdTLmServer including the bytes read count, the most recent raw data read, and it handles raw logging if enabled.
1. **write_interface_base** - This method should always be called from write_interface(). It updates interface specific variables that are displayed by CmdTLmServer including the bytes written count, the most recent raw data written, and it handles raw logging if enabled.
1. **read** - Read the next packet from the interface. COSMOS implements this method to allow the Protocol system to operate on the data and the packet before it is returned.
1. **write** - Send a packet to the interface. COSMOS implements this method to allow the Protocol system to operate on the packet and the data before it is sent.
1. **write_raw** - Send a raw binary string of data to the target. COSMOS implements this method by basically calling write_interface with the raw data.

:::warning Naming Conventions
When creating your own interfaces, in most cases they will be subclasses of one of the built-in interfaces described below. It is important to know that both the filename and class name of the interface files must match with correct capitalization or you will receive "class not found" errors when trying to load your new interface. For example, an interface file called labview_interface.rb must contain the class LabviewInterface. If the class was named, LabVIEWInterface, for example, COSMOS would not be able to find the class because of the unexpected capitalization.
