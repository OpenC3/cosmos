## Working configuration

This tutorial has been tested using the following components:

- COSMOS v5 release [5.0.6](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/releases/tag/v5.0.6)
- cFS master-branch commit: 561b128 (June 1, 2022)
- Docker Desktop 4.9.0 on Windows

Replace all `<xxxxxx>` with your matching paths and names. Example: `<USERNAME>`.

## Setting up COSMOS

Install COSMOS according to the official [installation](../getting-started/installation.md) instructions.

### Configuring COSMOS

Change the Docker configuration for the interoperability with NASA cFS. For
subscribing to the telemetry, you have to append a port binding in the file
`compose.yaml` under the section `openc3-operator`. The port number has to
match with the port number cFS is sending the telemetry on.

```yaml
openc3-operator:
  ports:
    - "1235:1235/udp"
```

Run COSMOS, the first run takes a while (~15 min).

```bash
openc3.sh start
```

When started, connect with a browser to [http://localhost:2900](http://localhost:2900).

For shutting down COSMOS:

```bash
openc3.sh stop
```

## Setting up cFS

To run [NASA cFS](https://github.com/nasa/cFS) as a Docker container do the following:

### Clone cFS

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nasa/cFS.git
```

### Create Dockerfile in cFS dir

```docker
FROM ubuntu:22.10 AS builder

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
ARG SIMULATION=native
ENV SIMULATION=${SIMULATION}
ARG BUILDTYPE=debug
ENV BUILDTYPE=${BUILDTYPE}
ARG OMIT_DEPRECATED=true
ENV OMIT_DEPRECATED=${OMIT_DEPRECATED}

RUN \
  apt-get update && \
  apt-get -y upgrade && \
  apt-get install -y build-essential git cmake && \
  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /cFS
COPY . .

RUN git submodule init \
  && git submodule update \
  && cp cfe/cmake/Makefile.sample Makefile \
  && cp -r cfe/cmake/sample_defs .

RUN make prep
RUN make
RUN make install

FROM ubuntu:22.10
COPY --from=builder /cFS/build /cFS/build
WORKDIR /cFS/build/exe/cpu1
ENTRYPOINT [ "./core-cpu1" ]
```

### Build and run cFS

Note we're connecting to the COSMOS network (`docker network ls`) and exposing the cFS ports.

```bash
docker build -t cfs .
docker run --cap-add CAP_SYS_RESOURCE --net=openc3-cosmos-network --name cfs -p1234:1234/udp -p1235:1235 cfs
```

## Creating a COSMOS plugin for TM/TC interface with cFS

The detailed instructions how to create a plugin, can be found
[here](../getting-started/gettingstarted.md), in the chapter "Interfacing with Your Hardware".

Create a new plugin with the name `CFS`. `CFS` is the name of the plugin and
must be in capital letters according to the COSMOS documentation. This command
should create the plugin structure. Then cd into the plugin to create the target.

```bash
# cd .. to the location of the cfs dir
$PATH_TO_OPENC3/openc3.sh cli generate plugin CFS
cd openc3-cosmos-cfs
$PATH_TO_OPENC3/openc3.sh cli generate target CFS
```

In this newly created plugin, change the `plugin.txt` file, so that the
communication happens over UDP. `port_tm` is the port number on which cFS
sends the telemetry messages. `port_tc` indicates the port on which cFS listens to the
telecommands.

```ruby
VARIABLE ip 127.0.0.1
VARIABLE port_tm 1235
VARIABLE port_tc 1234
VARIABLE cfs_target_name CFS

TARGET CFS <%= cfs_target_name %>
# hostname   write_dest_port   read_port   write_src_port   interface_address   ttl   write_timeout   read_timeout   bind_address
INTERFACE <%= cfs_target_name %>_INT udp_interface.rb <%= ip %> <%= port_tc %> <%= port_tm %> nil nil 128 nil nil
  MAP_TARGET <%= cfs_target_name %>
```

Note that the two arguments to the `TARGET` parameter are:

1. the physical target name that should match the name of the plugin, i.e. `CFS`.
   This name must match the folder name in the `targets` folder. Example: for the
   `CFS` plugin, the target specifications must be under
   `openc3-cfs/targets/CFS`. If you don't follow this
   convention, the server will refuse to install your plugin at the following steps.

1. the name of your target and how it is shown in the user interface.

In this example, we keep both names to be `CFS`.

## Creating TM/TC definitions

Change to the target folder and remove the existing files and create own files.

```bash
cd openc3-cfs/targets/CFS/cmd_tlm
rm *
touch cfs_cmds.txt
touch cfs_tlm.txt
touch to_lab_cmds.txt
```

Open these newly created files in a text editor and fill them with following
content.

`to_lab_cmds.txt`:

:::info Enabling Telemetry
The command `0x1880` is needed to enable telemetry. When the cFS receives
this command, it starts sending telemetry to the IP address provided via the
`DEST_IP` field.

Build the plugin from the base of your plugin folder:

```bash
# cd openc3-cfs
$PATH_TO_OPENC3/openc3.sh cli rake build VERSION=1.0.0
```

:::info Plugin versioning
Do not forget to change the version number with every build if you want to
better distinguish between the versions of the plugin. When the version is
seen in the plugin's .gem file name, it is easier to visualize the existing
versions and the newly uploaded versions.
:::

:::info Plugin parameters
Multiple parameters are available for the plugin configuration. See the [plugin](../configuration/plugins.md) page.
:::

## Uploading the plugin

After the plugin has been built, you can import the plugin in the admin area of
the page.

Connect with a browser to
[http://localhost:2900/tools/admin](http://localhost:2900/tools/admin).

Click on the clip icon and navigate to where your plugin is stored and select
the `openc3-cosmos-cfs-1.0.0.gem` file. Right of the selection line click on `UPLOAD`.

Determine the IP address the cFS container and COSMOS operator container are running at:

```bash
docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME             DRIVER    SCOPE
d842f813f1c7   openc3-cosmos-network   bridge    local

docker network inspect openc3-cosmos-network
[
    {
        "Name": "openc3-cosmos-network",
        ...
        "Containers": {
            "03cb6bf1b27c631fad1366e9342aeaa5b80f458a437195e4a95e674bb5f5983d": {
                "Name": "cfs",
                "IPv4Address": "172.20.0.9/16",
            },
            "ceb9ea99b00849fd8867dcd1646838fef3471f7d64b69014703dbedbcc8147fc": {
                "Name": "openc3_openc3-operator_1",
                "IPv4Address": "172.20.0.8/16",
            }
        }
        ...
    }
]
```

When using this plugin, make sure to change the `ip` variable during uploading
to match where cFS is running. In the example above you would set it to 172.20.0.9.
`port_tm` is the port number on which cFS is sending the telemetry messages.
`port_tc` indicates the port on cFS is listening for telecommands.

Under `cfs_target_name` you can change the target name of this plugin. This
step is optional as long as you are fine with your plugin showing up as `CFS`.

![Plugin Variable Settings](/img/guides/plugin_variables.png)

:::warning Port subscription
The last uploaded plugin on COSMOS will subscribe to TM on port 1235.
Other plugins will not receive any TM anymore.
:::

:::info Typo errors
Presence of typos in one of the plugin files can cause problems when uploading and installing
the plugin's .gem file. Make sure your configuration is typo-free.
:::

In the example above, the operator image is running at 172.20.0.8. To enable telemetry, go to the browser and connect to
[http://localhost:2900/tools/cmdsender/CFS/TO_LAB_ENABLE](http://localhost:2900/tools/cmdsender/CFS/TO_LAB_ENABLE). Change the `DEST_IP` to the IP address of the operator image (172.20.0.8) and send the command.

Under [http://localhost:2900/tools/cmdtlmserver/tlm-packets](http://localhost:2900/tools/cmdtlmserver/tlm-packets), you should see the incoming packets. Note in the CmdTlmServer you will also see CFS_INT UNKNOWN packets because we did not define the full cFS packet set. That exercise is left to the reader.
