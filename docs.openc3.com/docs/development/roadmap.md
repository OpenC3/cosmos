Please read the release notes on the [Releases](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/releases) page to learn about current functionality.

Our roadmap is captured via Github [Milestones](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/milestones). We have major milestones (6.0, 7.0, etc) and minor milestones (6.x, 7.x, etc) that incorporate new functionality, enhancements, bug fixes, and dependency updates. Note that we also release patch releases (6.5.1) that incorporate only minor enhancements, bug fixes, and dependency updates but these are not milestoned.

## Github Issues

We prioritize bugs and customer requests in our Github [issues](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/issues) list. If you're an OpenC3 customer, please reach out at [support@openc3.com](mailto:support@openc3.com) and let us know what issues you need prioritized.
