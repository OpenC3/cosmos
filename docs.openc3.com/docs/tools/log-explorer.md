### Log Viewing

- Real-time log updates when viewing recent data (if end time set to a future time)

### Search and Filtering
- Filter logs by date and time range
- Search log content using text-based queries
- Filter by log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Modify scope to Current Scope for regular log messages or NOSCOPE for system-level logs
- Apply multiple filters simultaneously

### Export Capabilities
- Export filtered log results to CSV format
- Export filtered log results to JSON format

## Notes

For Enterprise level log searching / filtering, we recommend using an Enterprise-level logging solution like ElasticSearch, Grafana Loki, Splunk, etc. This tool provides a quick and simple interface to view historical logs, but is not suited for searching multi-day amount of logs.
