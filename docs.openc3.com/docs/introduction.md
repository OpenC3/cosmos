This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to OpenC3 COSMOS. We'll cover topics such as getting your configuration up and running, developing test and operations scripts, building custom telemetry screens, and give you some advice on participating in the future development of COSMOS itself.

## So what is COSMOS, exactly?

COSMOS is a suite of applications that can be used to control a set of embedded systems. These systems can be anything from test equipment (power supplies, oscilloscopes, switched power strips, UPS devices, etc), to development boards (Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, etc), to satellites.

COSMOS is a cloud native, containerized, microservice oriented command and control system. See the [Architecture](/docs/getting-started/architecture) page for a detailed breakdown of both the Core and Enterprise architectures.

## Helpful Hints

Throughout this guide there are a number of small-but-handy pieces of
information that can make using COSMOS easier, more interesting, and less
hazardous. Here's what to look out for.
