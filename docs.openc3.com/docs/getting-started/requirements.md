OpenC3 COSMOS is a command and control system providing commanding, scripting, and data visualization capabilities for embedded systems and systems of systems. COSMOS is intended for use during all phases of testing (board, box, integrated system) and during operations.

COSMOS is currently made up of the following applications:

1. **Command and Telemetry Server** - Provides status of realtime commanding, telemetry reception, logging, limits monitoring, and packet routing.
1. **Limits Monitor** - Monitors telemetry with defined limits and shows items that currently are or have violated limits.
1. **Command Sender** - Provides a graphical interface for manually sending individual commands.
1. **Script Runner** - Executes scripts and provides highlighting of the currently executing line. Now also includes TestRunner functionality.
1. **Packet Viewer** - Provides realtime visualization of every telemetry packet that has been defined.
1. **Telemetry Viewer** - Provides custom telemetry screen functionality with advanced layout and visualization widgets.
1. **Telemetry Grapher** - Provides realtime and offline graphing of telemetry data.
1. **Data Extractor** - Extracts telemetry and command packet log files into CSV data.
1. **Data Viewer** - Provides text based telemetry visualization for items.
1. **Bucket Explorer** - Browse the COSMOS bucket storage in any cloud environment.
1. **Table Manager** - Binary file editor with Script Runner integration for upload / download.
1. **Handbooks** - Generate html page of the command and telemetry definitions.
1. **Calendar** - Provides scheduling of commands and scripts. Also provides a framework for reserving resources.
1. **Admin** - Provides an administrative interface to COSMOS.

More detailed descriptions, requirements, and design for each tool are found later in this document. Additionally, each of the above applications is built using COSMOS libraries that are available for use as a framework to develop custom program/project applications.

## Terminology

The COSMOS system uses several terms that are important to understand. The following table defines these terms.

| Term                | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Target              | A COSMOS target is an embedded system that the COSMOS Command and Telemetry Server connects to using an interface in order to send commands to and/or receive telemetry from.                                           |
| Command             | A packet of information telling a target to perform an action of some sort.                                                                                                                                             |
| Telemetry Packet    | A packet of information providing status from a target.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Interface           | A Ruby class that knows how to send commands to and/or receive telemetry from a target. COSMOS comes with interfaces that support TCP/IP, UDP, and serial connections. Custom interfaces are easy to add to the system. |
| Ruby                | The powerful dynamic programming language used to write the COSMOS applications and libraries as well as COSMOS scripts and test procedures.                                                                            |
| Configuration Files | COSMOS uses simple plain text configuration files to define commands and telemetry packets, and to configure each COSMOS application. These files are easily human readable/editable and machine readable/editable.     |
| Packet Log Files    | Binary files containing either logged commands or telemetry packets.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Message Log Files   | Text files containing messages generated by the system.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Tool                | Another name for a COSMOS application.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Overall Architecture and Context Diagram

The following diagram shows the current COSMOS architecture.

![COSMOS Architecture](/img/architecture.png)

Key aspects of this architecture:

Starting with the release of version 5, COSMOS is a cloud native, containerized, microservice oriented command and control system. All the COSMOS microservices are docker containers which is why Docker is shown containing the entire COSMOS system. The green boxes on the left represent external embedded systems (Targets) which COSMOS connects to. The Redis data store contains the configuration for all the microservices, the current value table, as well as data streams containing decommutated data. The Minio data store contains plugins, targets, configuration data, text logs as well as binary logs of all the raw, decommutated, and reduced data. Users interact with COSMOS from a web browser which routes through the internal Traefik load balancer.

- COSMOS can connect to many different kinds of targets. The examples include things like Flight software (FSW), Ground Support Equipment (GSE), Labview, and COTS targets such as an Agilent power supply. Any embedded system that provides a communication interface can be connected to COSMOS.
- COSMOS ships with interfaces for connecting over TCP/IP, UDP, MQTT, and serial connections. This covers most systems, but custom interfaces can also be written to connect to anything.
- All realtime communication with targets flows through the COSMOS system. This ensures all commands and telemetry are logged.
- Every tool is configured with plain text configuration files.
- Program specific tools can be written using the COSMOS libraries that can interact with the realtime command and telemetry streams and can process logged data.

After the user has selected the command, they then fill in the desired command parameters and click send to send the command to the target.

## Script Runner

Script Runner provides a visual interface for editing and executing scripts/procedures. A full featured text editor provides syntax highlighting and code completion while developing scripts. During script execution, the currently executing line is highlighted and any logged messages are highlighted to the user. If any failure occurs, the script is paused and the user alerted. The user can then decide whether to stop the script, or ignore the failure and continue. The user can also retry the failed lines, or other nearby lines before proceeding.

Script Runner now also provides a structured methodology for designing system level scripting that mirrors the very successful pattern used in software unit tests (previously implemented in the Test Runner tool). System level tests/procedures are built up of cases that are organized into groups. For example, you might have one group that verified all of the requirements associated with a particular mechanism. Ideally you would break this down into individual cases for different scenarios. One perhaps for opening a shutter, another for closing it, etc. Cases are ideally small and independent tasks. A number of these groups are then combined into an overall suite which would be run to execute a major test such as EMI, or software FQT.
