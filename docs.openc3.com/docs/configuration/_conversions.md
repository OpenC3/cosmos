# Overview

Conversions can be applied to both command parameters and telemetry items to modify the values sent to and received from targets. To apply a conversion to a command you use the [WRITE_CONVERSION](/docs/configuration/command#write_conversion) keyword. To apply a conversion to a telemetry item you use the [READ_CONVERSION](/docs/configuration/telemetry#read_conversion) keyword.

## Custom Conversions

You can easily create your own custom conversions by using the [Conversion Code Generator](/docs/getting-started/generators#conversion-generator). To generate a telemetry conversion you must be inside an existing COSMOS plugin. The generator takes both a target name and the conversion name. For example if your plugin is called `openc3-cosmos-gse` and you have an existing target named `GSE`:

```bash
openc3-cosmos-gse % openc3.sh cli generate conversion GSE double --python
Conversion targets/GSE/lib/double_conversion.py successfully generated!
To use the conversion add the following to a telemetry item:
  READ_CONVERSION double_conversion.py
```

Note: To create a Ruby conversion simply replace `--python` with `--ruby`.

The above command creates a conversion called `double_conversion.py` at `targets/GSE/lib/double_conversion.py`. The code which is generated looks like the following:

```python
from openc3.conversions.conversion import Conversion
# Using tlm() requires the following:
# from openc3.api.tlm_api import tlm

# Custom conversion class
# See https://docs.openc3.com/docs/configuration/telemetry#read_conversion
class DoubleConversion(Conversion):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Should be one of 'INT', 'UINT', 'FLOAT', 'STRING', 'BLOCK'
        self.converted_type = 'STRING'
        # Size of the converted type in bits
        # Use 0 for 'STRING' or 'BLOCK' where the size can be variable
        self.converted_bit_size = 0

    # @param value [Object] Value based on the item definition. This could be
    #   a string, integer, float, or array of values.
    # @param packet [Packet] The packet object where the conversion is defined
    # @param buffer [String] The raw packet buffer
    def call(self, value, packet, buffer):
        # Read values from the packet and do a conversion
        # Used for DERIVED items that don't have a value
        # item1 = packet.read("ITEM1") # returns CONVERTED value (default)
        # item2 = packet.read("ITEM2", 'RAW') # returns RAW value
        # return (item1 + item2) / 2
        #
        # Perform conversion logic directly on value
        # Used when conversion is applied to a regular (not DERIVED) item
        # NOTE: You can also use packet.read("ITEM") to get additional values
        # return value / 2 * packet.read("OTHER_ITEM")
        return value
```

There are a lot of comments to help you know what to do. The primary things to modify are the `converted_type`, `converted_bit_size`, and `call` method.

### converted_type

The `converted_type` is the resulting type of the converted value. It lets consumers of the converted value know the resulting type. In our case we're doubling the input value and since this could be applied to an unsigned integer as well as a floating point value we'll choose `FLOAT`.

```python
    self.converted_type = 'FLOAT'
```

### converted_bit_size

The `converted_bit_size` is the resulting size of the converted value. It lets consumers of the converted value know the resulting size. Since we chose `FLOAT` as the type we'll choose `32` as the bit size. We could have also chosen `64` bits. Sometimes you know the type and size of the resulting conversion and can simply hard code them. Other times you need to pass them in as parameters and let the user decide.

```python
    self.converted_bit_size = 32
```

### call

The call method is where the actual conversion logic is implemented. In our case we want to double the input value so we simply return the value multiplied by 2. The final result with comments removed looks like the following:

```python
from openc3.conversions.conversion import Conversion
class DoubleConversion(Conversion):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.converted_type = 'FLOAT'
        self.converted_bit_size = 32

    def call(self, value, packet, buffer):
        return value * 2
```

### Apply Conversion

Now that we have implemented the conversion logic we need to apply it to a telemetry item by adding the line `READ_CONVERSION double_conversion.py` in the [telemetry](/docs/configuration/telemetry) definition file. This could look something like this:

```bash
TELEMETRY GSE DATA BIG_ENDIAN "Data packet"
  ... # Header items
  APPEND_ITEM VALUE 16 UINT "Value I want to double"
    READ_CONVERSION double_conversion.py
```
