  # Stream that reads and writes to serial ports by using {SerialDriver}.
  class SerialStream < Stream
    # @param write_port_name [String] The name of the serial port to write.
    #   Pass nil if the stream is to be read only. On Windows the port name
    #   is typically 'COMX' where X can be any port number. On UNIX the port
    #   name is typically a device such as '/dev/ttyS0'.
    # @param read_port_name [String] The name of the serial port to read.
    #   Pass nil if the stream is to be read only. On Windows the port name
    #   is typically 'COMX' where X can be any port number. On UNIX the port
    #   name is typically a device such as '/dev/ttyS0'.
    # @param baud_rate [Integer] The serial port baud rate
    # @param parity [Symbol] Must be :NONE, :EVEN, or :ODD
    # @param stop_bits [Integer] Stop bits. Must be 1 or 2.
    # @param write_timeout [Integer] Seconds to wait for the write to complete.
    #   The {SerialDriver} will continuously try to send the data until
    #   it has been sent or an error occurs.
    # @param read_timeout [Integer] Seconds to wait for the read to complete.
    #   Pass nil to block until the read is complete. The {SerialDriver} will
    #   continuously try to read data until it has received data or an error occurs.
    # @param flow_control [Symbol] Currently supported :NONE and :RTSCTS (default :NONE)
    # @param data_bits [Integer] Number of data bits (default 8)
