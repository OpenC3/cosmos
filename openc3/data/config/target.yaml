TARGET:
  summary: Defines a new target
  example: TARGET KEYSIGHT_N6700 PWR_SUPPLY1
  parameters:
    - name: Folder Name
      required: true
      description: The target folder
      values: .*
    - name: Name
      required: true
      description: The target name. While this typically matches the Folder Name
        it can be different to create multiple targets based on the same target definition.
        As in the Example Usage, the target folder is KEYSIGHT_N6700 but the target name is PWR_SUPPLY1.
        To create multiple targets from the same folder, just define multiple TARGET entries
        with different target names. To make the target definition flexbible, you can use ERB to
        insert the target name in procedures, libraries, etc via &lt;%= target_name %&gt;.
        See [ERB target_name](/docs/configuration/format#target_name) for more information.
