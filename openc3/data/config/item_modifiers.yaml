STATE:
  summary: Defines a key/value pair for the current item
  description: Key value pairs allow for user friendly strings. For example,
    you might define states for ON = 1 and OFF = 0. This allows the word ON to be
    used rather than the number 1 when sending the telemetry item and allows
    for much greater clarity and less chance for user error. A catch all value
    of ANY applies to all other values not already defined as state values.
  example: |
    APPEND_ITEM ENABLE 32 UINT "Enable setting"
      STATE FALSE 0
      STATE TRUE 1
      STATE ERROR ANY # Match all other values to ERROR
    APPEND_ITEM STRING 1024 STRING "String"
      STATE "NOOP" "NOOP" GREEN
      STATE "ARM LASER" "ARM LASER" YELLOW
      STATE "FIRE LASER" "FIRE LASER" RED
  parameters:
    - name: Key
      required: true
      description: The string state name
      values: .*
    - name: Value
      required: true
      description: The numerical state value or ANY to apply the state to all other values
      values: .*
    - name: Color
      required: false
      description: The color the state should be displayed as
      values: ['GREEN', 'YELLOW', 'RED']
READ_CONVERSION:
  summary: Applies a conversion to the current telemetry item
  description: Conversions are implemented in a custom Ruby or Python file which should be
    located in the target's lib folder. The class must inherit from Conversion.
    It must implement the `initialize` (Ruby) or `__init__` (Python) method if it
    takes extra parameters and must always implement the `call` method. The conversion
    factor is applied to the raw value in the telemetry packet before it is displayed
    to the user. The user still has the ability to see the raw unconverted value
    in a details dialog. For more information see the [Conversion](/docs/configuration/conversions) documentation.
  parameters:
    - name: Class Filename
      required: true
      description: The filename which contains the Ruby or Python class. The filename must
        be named after the class such that the class is a CamelCase version of the
        underscored filename. For example, 'the_great_conversion.rb' should contain
        'class TheGreatConversion'.
      values: .*
    - name: Parameter
      required: false
      description: Additional parameter values for the conversion which are passed
        to the class constructor.
      values: .*

POLY_READ_CONVERSION:
  summary: Adds a polynomial conversion factor to the current telemetry item
  description: See [Polynomial Conversion](/docs/configuration/conversions#polynomial_conversion) for more information.
SEG_POLY_READ_CONVERSION:
  summary: Adds a segmented polynomial conversion factor to the current telemetry item
  description: See [Segmented Polynomial Conversion](/docs/configuration/conversions#segmented_polynomial_conversion) for more information.
GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_START:
  summary: Start a generic read conversion
  description: Adds a generic conversion function to the current telemetry item.
    This conversion factor is applied to the raw value in the telemetry packet
    before it is displayed to the user. The user still has the ability to see the
    raw unconverted value in a details dialog. The conversion is specified as
    Ruby or Python code that receives two implied parameters. 'value' which is the raw
    value being read and 'packet' which is a reference to the telemetry packet
    class (Note, referencing the packet as 'myself' is still supported for backwards
    compatibility). The last line of code should return the converted
    value. The GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END keyword specifies that all lines of
    code for the conversion have been given.
  warning: Generic conversions are not a good long term solution. Consider creating
    a conversion class and using READ_CONVERSION instead. READ_CONVERSION is easier
    to debug and has higher performance.
  ruby_example: |
    APPEND_ITEM ITEM1 32 UINT
      GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_START
        return (value * 1.5).to_i # Convert the value by a scale factor
      GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END
  python_example: |
    APPEND_ITEM ITEM1 32 UINT
      GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_START
        return int(value * 1.5) # Convert the value by a scale factor
      GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END
  parameters:
    - name: Converted Type
      required: false

GENERIC_READ_CONVERSION_END:
  summary: Complete a generic read conversion
LIMITS:
  summary: Defines a set of limits for a telemetry item
  description: If limits are violated a message is printed in the Command and Telemetry Server
    to indicate an item went out of limits. Other tools also use this information
    to update displays with different colored telemetry items or other useful information.
    The concept of "limits sets" is defined to allow for different limits values
    in different environments. For example, you might want tighter or looser limits
    on telemetry if your environment changes such as during thermal vacuum testing.
  example: |
    LIMITS DEFAULT 3 ENABLED -80.0 -70.0 60.0 80.0 -20.0 20.0
    LIMITS TVAC 3 ENABLED -80.0 -30.0 30.0 80.0
  parameters:
    - name: Limits Set
      required: true
      description: Name of the limits set. If you have no unique limits sets use
        the keyword DEFAULT.

      description: Number of consecutive times the telemetry item must be within
        a different limits range before changing limits state.

    - name: Initial State
      required: true
      description: Whether limits monitoring for this telemetry item is initially enabled or disabled.
        Note if you have multiple LIMITS items they should all have the same initial state.

    - name: Green Low Limit
      required: false
      description: Setting the Green Low and Green High limits defines an
        "operational limit" which is colored blue by OpenC3. This allows for a
        distinct desired operational range which is narrower than the green safety limit.

        than the Green High Limit, a Blue operational condition will be detected.
