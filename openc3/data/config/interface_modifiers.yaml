    manually parse these logs yourself using a hex editor or other application.

PROTOCOL:
  summary: Protocols modify the interface by processing the data
  description:

    received by the interface while write acts on the data before it is sent out. READ_WRITE applies
    the protocol to both reading and writing.<br/><br/>
    For information on creating your own custom protocol please see [Protocols](../configuration/protocols.md)

OPTION:
  summary: Set a parameter on an interface
  description:
    When an option is set the interface class calls the set_option method.
    Custom interfaces can override set_option to handle any additional options they want.
  parameters:
    - name: Name
      required: true
      description:
        The option to set. OpenC3 defines several options on the core provided
        interfaces. The SerialInterface defines FLOW_CONTROL which can be NONE (default) or RTSCTS
        and DATA_BITS which changes the data bits of the serial interface.
        The TcpipServerInterface and HttpServerInterface define LISTEN_ADDRESS which is the IP address to accept
        connections on (default 0.0.0.0).
