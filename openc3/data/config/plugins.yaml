VARIABLE:
  summary: Define a configurable variable for the plugin
  description: The VARIABLE keyword defines a variable that will be requested for the user to enter during plugin installation.   Variables can be used to handle details of targets that are user defined such as specific IP addresses and ports.  Variables should also be used to allow users to rename targets to whatever name they want and support multiple installations of the same target with different names.
    Variables can be used later in plugin.txt or in any other configuration file included in a plugin using Ruby ERB syntax.  The variables are assigned to accessible local variables in the file.
    At a high level, ERB allows you to run Ruby code in configuration files.
  parameters:
    - name: Variable Name
      required: true
      description: The name of the variable
      values: .+
    - name: Default Value
      required: true
      description: Default value of the variable
      values: .+
VARIABLE_DESCRIPTION:
  summary: Add a description to a plugin variable
  description: The VARIABLE_DESCRIPTION keyword adds a human-readable description to a previously defined VARIABLE. This description appears as hint text below the variable input field during plugin installation. Must follow a VARIABLE definition.
  since: 7.0.0
  example: |
    VARIABLE port 8080
    VARIABLE_DESCRIPTION port "TCP port for the target connection"
  parameters:
    - name: Variable Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the variable to describe. Must match a previously defined VARIABLE name.
      values: .+
    - name: Description
      required: true
      description: Human-readable description of the variable's purpose
      values: .+
VARIABLE_STATE:
  summary: Add a selectable state for a plugin variable
  description: The VARIABLE_STATE keyword defines a selectable state for a previously defined VARIABLE. When states are defined for a variable, it renders as a dropdown/combobox in the plugin installation dialog instead of a text field. Users can still type custom values if needed. Multiple VARIABLE_STATE keywords can be used to define multiple states. Must follow a VARIABLE definition.
  since: 7.0.0
  example: |
    VARIABLE target_name INST
    VARIABLE_DESCRIPTION target_name "Select the target name"
    VARIABLE_STATE target_name INST "Primary instrument"
    VARIABLE_STATE target_name INST2 "Secondary instrument"
  parameters:
    - name: Variable Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the variable this state belongs to. Must match a previously defined VARIABLE name.
      values: .+
    - name: State Value
      required: true
      description: The value that will be used when this state is selected
      values: .+
    - name: State Description
      required: false
      description: Human-readable description of what this state represents. Appears as subtitle in the dropdown.
      values: .+
NEEDS_DEPENDENCIES:
  summary: Indicates the plugin needs dependencies and sets the GEM_HOME environment variable
  description: If the plugin has a top level lib folder or lists runtime dependencies in the gemspec,
    NEEDS_DEPENDENCIES is effectively already set. Note that in Enterprise, having
    NEEDS_DEPENDENCIES adds the NFS volume mount to the Kubernetes pod.
  since: 5.5.0
INTERFACE:
  modifiers:
    <%= MetaConfigParser.load('interface_modifiers.yaml').to_meta_config_yaml(4) %>
  summary: Defines a connection to a physical target
  description: Interfaces are what OpenC3 uses to talk to a particular piece
    of hardware. Interfaces require a Ruby or Python file which implements all the interface
    methods necessary to talk to the hardware. OpenC3 defines many built in interfaces
    or you can define your own as long as it implements the interface protocol.
  parameters:
    - name: Interface Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the interface. This name will appear in the
        Interfaces tab of the Server and is also referenced by other keywords.
        The OpenC3 convention is to name interfaces after their targets with
        '_INT' appended to the name, e.g. INST_INT for the INST target.
      values: \D\S*
    - name: Filename
      required: true
      description: Ruby or Python file to use when instantiating the interface.
      values:
        <%= MetaConfigParser.load('_interfaces.yaml').to_meta_config_yaml(8) %>
      documentation: Additional parameters are required. Please see the [Interfaces](../configuration/interfaces.md)
        documentation for more details.
ROUTER:
  modifiers:
    <%= MetaConfigParser.load('interface_modifiers.yaml').to_meta_config_yaml(4) %>
  summary: Create router to receive commands and output telemetry packets from one or more interfaces
  description: Creates an router which receives command packets from
    their remote clients and sends them to associated interfaces. They receive telemetry
    packets from their interfaces and send them to their remote clients. This allows
    routers to be intermediaries between an external client and an actual device.
  parameters:
    - name: Name
      required: true
      description: Name of the router
      values: .+
    - name: Filename
      required: true

      values:
        <%= MetaConfigParser.load('_interfaces.yaml').to_meta_config_yaml(8) %>
      documentation: Additional parameters are required. Please see the [Interfaces](../configuration/interfaces.md)
        documentation for more details.
<%= MetaConfigParser.load('target.yaml').to_meta_config_yaml() %>
