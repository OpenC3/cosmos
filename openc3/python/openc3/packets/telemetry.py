class Telemetry:
    """Telemetry uses PacketConfig to parse the command and telemetry
    configuration files. It contains all the knowledge of which telemetry packets
    exist in the system and how to access them. This class is the API layer
    which other classes use to access telemetry.

    This should not be confused with the Api module which implements the JSON
    API that is used by tools when accessing the Server. The Api module always
    provides Ruby primitives where the Telemetry class can return actual
    Packet or PacketItem objects. While there are some overlapping methods between
    the two, these are separate interfaces into the system."""
